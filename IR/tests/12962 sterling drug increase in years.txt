	SMITHKLINE <SKB> AIMS FOR 10 PCT EARNINGS RAISE

CONTENT:
	SmithKline Beckman Corp said it is
	pursuing a three-point stragey that will achieve a 10 pct
	annual increase in operating earnings throughout the remainder
	of the decade.
	    In 1986, SmithKline earned 521.1 mln dlrs or 6.78 dlrs per
	share on revenues of 3.6 billion dlrs.
	    The company said in its annual report that its
	nonpharmaceutical business will play a major role in meeting
	its earnings growth target, and will in fact grow faster than
	its pharmaceutical business.
	    SmithKline, whose major product is the antiulcer medication
	Tagamet, said in the report that it intends to improve earnings
	from existing products, expand its product portfolio and
	optimize its financial resources.
	    To bolster its position in the antiulcer market, in which
	Tagamet has met stiff competition, SmithKline said its strategy
	to develop an over-the-counter version of Tagamet is bolstered
	by two joint ventures, one with <Wellcome PLC>, and one pending
	venture in Japan.
	    SmithKline also said its Allergan Inc eye and skin care
	products division can be a one billion dlr organization in the
	next five years that can grow at more than seven to 10 pct
	annually.
	    "Nondilutive acquisitions are a real possibility," Gavin
	Herbert, president of the eye and skin care product group said
	in the report. In 1986, Allergan had worldwide sales of 433 mln
	dlrs.
	    It said its Smith Kline and French Laboratories
	pharmaceuticals unit, with 1986 sales of 1.9 billion dlrs, will
	file for Food and Drug Administration marketing approval for a
	number of cardiovascular agents, including tissue plasminogen
	activator, over the next two years.
	    It also said SK and F's U.S. sales force will be 20 pct
	larger in 1987, with more than 1,000 sales personnel.
	    Smith Kline also said its small clinical laboratory testing
	unit, with 1986 sales of 373 mln dlrs, performs 24 mln tests a
	year, and sees increases in employee drug testing as well as in
	testing for the AIDS antibody.
	    Smith Kline said that depending on its share price and the
	cost of money, it may buy back more shares. In the last three
	years, it has bought back about 25 pct of its shares.
	    SmithKline begins the year with a new management team,
	including its new chief operating officer George Ebright.

	U.K. CENTRAL BANK WARNS OF EXCESSIVE RATE CUTS

PLACES:

CONTENT:
	Bank of England governor Robin
	Leigh-Pemberton said lowering interest rates too fast could
	jeopardise recent economic achievements in the U.K.
	    In remarks prepared for delivery to businessmen in
	Birmingham, he said prospective returns on real investment are
	more favourable, relative to those on financial assets, than
	for a good number of years.
	    "It would surely be foolish to put that favourable
	conjuncture at risk by lowering interest rates prematurely or
	excessively," he said.
	    "We might enjoy a short-term boost to activity, but at the
	risk of a damaging return to the uncertainty and acrimony of
	high inflation," he added.
	    Leigh-Pemberton said he recognised there are some who would
	argue that interest rates are still too high and deter
	investment in industry.
	    "But we should not forget that less than a year ago we were
	intervening to support sterling and had some temporary
	difficulty in persuading the markets that a one pct increase in
	base rates, to 11 pct, was a sufficient tightening of policy at
	the time," he added. Base rate is currently nine pct.

	ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - IRISH BUDGET
TOPICS:
	
PLACES:
	ireland
CONTENT:
	New Irish Prime Minister Charles
	Haughey, faced with a debt-ridden economy, will have to produce
	a harsh budget next week to impress financial markets, appease
	political opponents and maintain his tenuous hold on power,
	analysts said.
	    For Haughey, who failed to win an overall majority in last
	month's election, only scraped back into power when the speaker
	in parliament stepped in with his casting vote to decide a tied
	vote on who would be the next Prime Minister.
	    Heading a minority government and faced with a stagnant
	economy weighed down by debt, he has little room for manoeuvre.
	    The national debt has now reached 24.3 billion punts --
	10,000 dlrs for every man, woman and child on the island and
	per capita three times the size of Mexico's.
	    Its 19 pct unemployment rate is one of the highest in the
	European Community and 30,000 youngsters emigrate every year.
	The 58 pct income tax level could hardly be raised again.
	    Haughey, declining to be tied down on specifics, promised
	on the election trail to get Ireland out of the debt trap with
	an annual growth rate of 2.5 pct, compared to central bank
	predictions of 1.5 pct. Jobs were his top priority, he said.
	    For his crucial first budget, Haughey has ruled out any
	increase in the level of government borrowing and forecast
	"widespread cutbacks with severe restrictions right across the
	board."
	    Finance Minister Ray MacSharry also stressed that some of
	the 187,000 civil service jobs must go to trim Ireland's annual
	public wages bill of 2.84 billion punts.
	    "The big question now is to what extent he will grasp the
	nettle and cut in next Tuesday's budget," said Kevin Barry,
	economist with National and City Brokers.
	    "You have to cut the Exchequer Borrowing Recquirement (EBR)
	substantially and swiftly. He has to do it now," Barry said.
	    Noting that last year's EBR was 2.145 billion punts, he
	said "Two billion would be good news. The markets are already
	taking the view it is going to be tough."
	    "He has absolutely no room to maneouvre. He cannot spend to
	stimulate the economy. I don't see any good news in the
	short-term."
	    But he, like other analysts, rules out a debt-servicing
	crisis that would mean calling in the International Monetary
	Fund (IMF). "It's too easy to borrow aboard," he added.
	    The steady rise of sterling, the currency of one of
	Ireland's main trading partners, has been a boost to Irish
	exporters with the country recording a 31 mln punt trade
	surplus in February, the 10th surplus in a row.
	    Political uncertainty is not a major factor for the punt
	because the main political parties are all essentially
	conservative with no major economic policy switches expected.
	    New Fine Gael leader Alan Dukes, who replaced ousted Prime
	Minister Garret Fitzgerald at the head of the main opposition
	party, has pledged to back Haughey's budget if, as expected, he
	gets tough.
	    Haughey is four short of an overall majority and would have
	to rely on the support of independent deputies if all four
	opposition parties united to vote against him.
	    But in today's climate of economic austerity, few
	politicians would risk returning to the polls so soon and
	Haughey could cling to power for at least another two years if
	he brings in a belt-tightening budget next week, political
	commentators say.
	    The debt-laden economy is the great national preoccupation,
	pushing firmly into the background for now Haughey's ultimate
	dream of a united Ireland with the British out of the north.
	    H.J. Heinz chairman Tony O'Reilly, one of the most
	successful Irishmen in international business, stressed the
	need for a frontal attack on the national debt, arguing "many of
	our children have lost faith in the future."
	    "Were there to be an uptick in world interest rates or a
	precipitous decline in our parities, the effect on our economy
	and on the provision of services by our government would be
	catastrophic," he said.
	    This island of 3.5 mln people has been living beyond its
	means with a state spending spree on welfare benefits that
	could not be financed by economic growth.

	LAWSON SAYS LOUVRE CURRENCY ACCORD SATISFACTORY
TOPICS:

PLACES:

CONTENT:
	The Louvre agreement by the Group of Seven
	finance ministers and central bankers to stabilise currencies
	has worked well and needs no fundamental strengthening at the
	economic summit in Venice on June 8-10, U.K. Chancellor of the
	Exchequer Nigel Lawson said.
	    Previewing the summit, which he expected would not produce
	any major new economic initiatives, Lawson told reporters work
	remained to be done on improving the conditions for lasting
	world economic growth.üside measures to boost growth, he said.
	
	    "I think it is possible that there may be scope for a
	further reduction in interest rates in Germany," he added, but
	stressed that he had had no indication that such a move was
	likely. He made no mention of Japanese interest rates.
	    Lawson said the U.S. Should embark on "a gradual reduction
	of its fiscal deficits over the next two or three years."
	    He said the February 22 Louvre accord had produced
	"satisfactory exchange rate stability," in part thanks to heavy
	coordinated intervention of Group of Seven central banks, and
	he was "content" with sterling's exchange rate.
	    Pointing to the record 4.8 billion stg rise in U.K. May
	currency reserves announced today he said, "we have been playing
	a very full part ourselves ... We have been intervening to a
	very much greater extent than we had done hitherto."
	    Lawson said there was a risk that the Louvre agreement may
	falter if member states did not implement the macro-economic
	commitments underlying the accord.
	    "Certainly it would be more difficult to maintain exchange
	rate stability if countries are seen not to implement their
	commitments in Paris ... In this respect." He said the U.S.
	Budget deficit was "very important."
	    Noting the 6,000 billion yen economic package announced by
	Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone last week Lawson
	said, "what is really needed in Japan is an increase in
	merchandise imports. Supply side measures are critical."
	    "There is a specific range of consumer and agricultural
	goods where they have an extremely restrictive regime which is
	wholly unjustified," he said.
	    Lawson doubted that Tokyo's partners would indulge in "Japan
	bashing" at the summit especially after the economic stimulation
	package and the announcement of Nakasone's plans to increase
	Japanese development aid over the next three years.
	    Japan's more flexible stance on Tokyo stock exchange
	membership would also help deflect criticism, he said.
	    He said he thought West Germany would instead come under
	pressure at the summit to adopt similar stimulation measures to
	jack up faltering economic growth.
	    In this respect Lawson said he hoped Bonn would bring
	forward to January 1988 part of its agreed package of tax cuts
	scheduled for 1990. He also called on Bonn to push ahead with
	the privatisation of German national industries.
	    On debt, Lawson said he expected a three point British plan
	to alleviate the burden of the poorest sub-saharan countries to
	make progress in Venice.
	    The plan, involving concessional rescheduling of sovereign
	debt in the Paris Club, was first proposed at the IMF and World
	Bank meetings in Washington earlier this year.
	    Lawson said he would seek "to consolidate political backing
	for the plan at the Venice summit" and hoped the programme would
	be finalised at the Autumn meetings of the IMF and World Bank.
	    He welcomed the recent moves by Citicorp and Chase
	Manhattan to increase sharply their Third World debt
	provisions.
	    "First, it is a blow for realism. Second, because the market
	response has shown that banks have much less to fear from this
	sort of move than they felt before Citicorp," he said.
	    U.K. Banks should follow Bank of England recommendations,
	strengthening their balance sheets and making more provisions.
	"They have done it to some extent, they need to do it more,"
	Lawson said, adding it was up to the banks themselves to
	determine the appropriate size of provisions.
	    He also said the dismantling of farm subsidies would be
	discussed at the summit. "There is a consensus, which we have to
	push further."

	Fisons Plc <FISN.L> said strong
	international growth had been the main feature of the group's
	1986 progress, with the pharmaceutical division reporting a 50
	pct increase in U.S. Sales during the period.
	    The rise was due to a sustained marketing programme, a
	larger sales force and the introduction of an aerosol form of
	its Intal anti-asthma drug, which pushed U.S. Sales up 70 pct.
	    The company was commenting on 1986 results which saw
	pre-tax profits rising to 85.1 mln stg from 72.3 mln in 1985.
	The result was in line with market forecasts, but its shares
	nevertheless eased in a falling market to 634p at 0857 GMT from
	643p.
	    Fisons said the potential for future growth of Intral, as
	well as its Opticrom and Nasalcrom products, was clearly
	indicated by a strong 1986 performance.
	    The scientific equipment business had raised the proportion
	of high technology products it manufactures and also raised its
	ability to generate higher margins. The horticulture operations
	had demonstrated outstanding marketing ability. Underlying cash
	flow from all three operations had been positive despite a full
	programme of capital investment.
	    Action to protect the group against foreign currency

	The Food and Drug Administration said
	stepped up testing of condoms by the agency has led to a three
	recalls by U.S. manufacturers and the detention of foreign-made
	condoms at U.S. borders.
	    The FDA said industry standards require that roughly no
	more than four out of 1,000 condoms leak. Condoms are tested by
	pouring 10 ounces of water in each and looking for leakage.
	    The FDA said Schmid Laboratories of Little Falls, N.J., has

	was distributed to 22 accounts through the United States.
	   
	    The agency said Schmid reported that almost all of the
	condoms were still in transit or at wholesalers at the time of
	the recall and are being recovered.
	    National Sanitary Labs of Lincolnwood, Ill, voluntarily
	recalled a lot of Protex Contracept Plus brand latex condoms
	which were distributed to a wholesaler in California and two
	retailers in Indiana and Michigan, the FDA said.
	    The FDA said National estimates that none of the suspect
	lot remains on the market. The FDA also said National recalled
	two more lots of condoms following additional FDA tests.
	    The FDA also said Circle Rubber Corp of Newark, N.J., is
	voluntarily recalling Saxon and L'appel condoms after being
	informed of FDA test results. The FDA said the condoms were
	distributed in North Carolina and Illinois.
	    The FDA urged condom makers on April 7 to inform consumers
	about how condoms should be used to increase protection against
	sexually transmitted diseases, including AIDS. Since April, the
	FDA said it had detained 15 shipments of condoms made by firms
