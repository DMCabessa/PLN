	U.S. warships destroyed an Iranian oil
	platform in the Gulf on Monday and the Navy also raided a
	second oil rig in retaliation for Friday's Iranian missile
	attack on a U.S. flag tanker, the Pentagon said.
	    President Reagan and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger
	warned Iran of even stronger countermeasures if the military
	escalation between the two countries continued in the volatile
	waterway.
	    Reagan said he ordered the strike on the first platform by
	four U.S. destroyers, which fired about 1,000 five-inch shells
	at the Rostam oil rig 120 miles east of Bahrain in the central
	Gulf.
	    A short time later, Navy personnel boarded a second Iranian
	oil platform about five miles to the north and destroyed radar
	and communications equipment before leaving the structure, the
	Pentagon said.
	     Defense Department spokesman Fred Hoffman told reporters
	that the second platform had been abandoned by Iranian
	personnel during the shelling and destruction of the first rig.
	    The United States said both platforms were being used to
	keep track of Gulf merchant shipping and to launch speedboat
	attacks on such shipping by Iranian Revolutionary guards.

	LATEST ATTACK SEEN POINTING UP DILEMMAS FOR US

CONTENT:
	Military experts say the United States
	faces a dilemma in the Gulf following U.S. destruction of an
	Iranian oil platform in retaliation for an attack on a
	U.S.-flagged tanker.
	    The experts told Reuters Tehran holds the initiative and is
	likely to control the tempo and direction of the conflict as
	long as America simply reacts to Iranian attacks by launching
	limited retaliatory strikes.
	    But if Washington seizes the initiative with bolder steps
	-- such as mining Iran's harbors, blockading its shipping, or
	destroying key bases -- it could find itself in a major war.
	    "Iran is in the driver's seat in an absolute sense as the
	cycle of attack and retaliation continues," said Fred Axelgard,
	a Gulf War expert with the private Center for Strategic and
	International Studies (CSIS).
	    "It's like a Greek tragedy," said retired Adm. Eugene Carroll
	of Washington's private Center for Defense Information (CDI)
	think tank.
	    Some Middle East experts say the only way out is for
	Washington to join forces with Moscow in pressing for an end to
	the war between Iran and Iraq.
	    They say it is not feasible for America to withdraw its
	30-ship force from the Gulf area, where the Navy began
	escorting U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers in July. Withdrawal 
	would give the appearance of being chased away by Iran, which
	President Reagan could never accept.
	    U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger told a Pentagon
	news conference the destroyers Kidd, Young, Leftwich and Hoel
	fired about 1,000 rounds of five-inch shells at Iran's Rostam
	oil rig 120 miles east of Bahrain beginning at about 1400 Gulf
	time (0700 EDT) on Monday.
	    Weinberger said the platform had been used as a military
	base by Iran and that the attack responded to an Iranian
	Silkworm missile strike on the U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker Sea
	Isle City on Friday.
	    Iranians manning the platform were warned in advance and
	allowed to escape.
	    "We do not seek further confrontation with Iran, but we will
	be prepared to meet any escalation of military action by Iran
	with stronger countermeasures," Weinberger said.
	    "We consider this matter closed," he said.
	    Analysts ranging from the liberal CDI to conservatives
	agreed the U.S. reaction was measured, reasonable and did not
	escalate the conflict unduly. But they said the question was
	whether Iran would consider the matter closed. It had not taken
	this view after earlier clashes.

CONTENT:
	A U.S. attack on an Iranian oil platform
	in the Gulf on Monday appeared to be a tit-for-tat raid
	carefully orchestrated not to be too provocative or upset Arab
	allies, Western diplomats in the region said.
	    U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger said Monday that
	U.S. Warships destroyed the oil platform in the southern Gulf
	in response to a missile strike on the American-registered
	Kuwaiti tanker Sea Isle City in Kuwaiti waters on Friday.
	    "We consider the matter closed," he said, a signal the U.S.
	administration did not want the Gulf crisis to escalate.
	    Iran had warned the United States earlier in the day
	against exacerbating the Gulf crisis, saying military action
	would endanger American interests.
	    Following the raid, a okesman for Tehran's War
	Information Headquarters vowed to avenge the attack with a
	"crushing blow."
	    "The United States has entered a swamp from which it can in
	no way get out safely," Tehran Radio quoted him as saying.
	    Diplomats noted, however, Iran was also seeking to avoid
	ostracism by Arab states due to meet at a summit in Amman on
	November 8 and discuss the Iran-Iraq war.
	    Iranian Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi is currently in
	Damascus, and diplomats said he would seek Syrian help in
	preventing a total Arab breach with Tehran.
	    Further escalation of the war threatening the Gulf Arab
	states could work against Tehran at the Amman gathering, they
	said.
	    "The ball is in Iran's court now. It's up to Tehran to
	respond one way or the other," a diplomat said.
	    President Ronald Reagan warned Iran of stronger American
	countermeasures if the military escalation continued.
	    Western diplomats and military sources in the area said
	shelling the platform appeared to be the least provocative act
	the United States could have taken once it had decided to
	retaliate for the tanker attack, blamed by both the Americans
	and Kuwaitis on Iran.
	    "It's interesting that they chose something in international
	waters because it doesn't implicate any other nation," one
	diplomat said. "This was better for U.S. Relations with the Gulf
	Arab states, particularly Kuwait."
	    Commented another diplomat: "Kuwait must be happy that the
	U.S. Has done something, but relieved that Faw was not attacked
	on its doorstep."
	    One source said of the attack on the oil platform: "They
	managed to warn off the crew and hit something that was the
	least nuisance to everybody."
	    A diplomat commented: "They were very clever in the place
	they chose. It gets attention, but it hasn't devastated
	anything because it wasn't working in the first place."
	    A senior Arab banker in the area said after the news broke:
	"This was a good, measured response without risking a flare-up
	... It is a face-saving response (for the Americans)."

	AMPLE SUPPLIES LIMIT U.S. STRIKE'S OIL PRICE IMPACT
TOPICS:

CONTENT:
	Ample supplies of OPEC crude weighing on
	world markets helped limit and then reverse oil price gains
	that followed the U.S. Strike on an Iranian oil platform in the
	Gulf earlier on Monday, analysts said.
	    December loading rose to 19.65 dlrs, up 45 cents before
	falling to around 19.05/15 later, unchanged from last Friday.
	    "Fundamentals are awful," said Philip Lambert, analyst with
	stockbrokers Kleinwort Grieveson, adding that total OPEC
	production in the first week of October could be above 18.5 mln
	bpd, little changed from September levels.
	    Peter Nicol, analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank, said OPEC
	production could be about 18.5-19.0 mln in October. Reuter and
	International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates put OPEC September
	production at 18.5 mln bpd.
	    The U.S. Attack was in retaliation of last Friday's hit of
	a Kuwaiti oil products tanker flying the U.S. Flag, the Sea
	Isle City. It was struck by a missile, believed to be Iranian,
	in Kuwaiti waters, and was the first hit on a U.S. Flag
	commercial vessel in the seven year Iran/Iraq war.
	    The U.S. Owned Liberian flag tanker Sungari was hit in the
	area on Thursday, also believed struck by an Iranian missile.
	    Refiners were not significant purchasers of physical oil on
	Monday as a result increased Gulf tension following the U.S.
	Attack, analysts said.
	    They said a closure of the Strait of Hormuz, through which
	around eight mln bpd passes, isnlikely because it is not in
	the interests of the U.S. Or Iran, they said.
	    Any threat to oil supplies would stem from an increase in
	the number of tanker attacks as part of a widening of Gulf
	hostilities, analysts said.
	    But they saw the U.S. Strike as a limited reply to Iranian
	missile attacks, with some describing it as responsible.
	    Geoffrey Pyne, analyst at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew,
	said he was impressed by the sensible U.S. Response.
	    "The U.S. Has thought carefully about what would correspond
	to Iranian agression. They have proved to the Iranians that any
	further action will be met with a like-for-like response.
	Today's action by the U.S. Was not escalatory," Pyne said.
	    Kleinwort Grieveson's Lambert said the U.S. Strike was "a
	responsible retaliation," with the U.S. Apparently indicating to
	Iran that it could increase the severity of its attacksf Iran
	chose to raise the level of conflict.
	    Chase Manhattan's Nicol took a different view, however.
	    He said he was unable to see what the U.S. Had achieved as
	Arab states such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, whose interests
	the U.S. Is supposedly defending, will feel less secure as a
	result of the U.S. Attack and fear some sort of Iranian
	retaliation.
	    The initial upward market move this morning reflected a
	strong speculative reaction to rumours of a U.S. Attack which
	was thought at one stage to have been against Iranian missile
	launchers on the Faw Peninsula, close to Kuwait, analysts said.
	    The later downtrend followed confirmation of a U.S. Navy
	attack on an Iranian oil platform by the U.S. Defence Secretary
	Caspar Weinburger.
	    Market operators were able to evaluate the situation in the
	Gulf on the basis of confirmed fact, and finding it less
	serious than first thought, took profits, taking prices lower,
	analysts and traders said.

	Huge oil platforms dot the Gulf like
	beacons -- usually lit up like Christmas trees at night.
	    One of them, sitting astride the Rostam offshore oilfield,
	was all but blown out of the water by U.S. Warships on Monday.
	    The Iranian platform, an unsightly mass of steel and
	concrete, was a three-tier structure rising 200 feet (60
	metres) above the warm waters of the Gulf until four U.S.
	Destroyers pumped some 1,000 shells into it.
	    The U.S. Defense Department said just 10 pct of one section
	of the structure remained.
	    U.S. helicopters destroyed three Iranian gunboats after an
	American helicopter came under fire earlier this month and U.S.
	forces attacked, seized, and sank an Iranian ship they said had
	been caught laying mines.
	    But Iran was not deterred, according to U.S. defense
	officials, who said Iranian forces used Chinese-made Silkworm
	missiles to hit a U.S.-owned Liberian-flagged ship on Thursday
	and the Sea Isle City on Friday.
	    Both ships were hit in the territorial waters of Kuwait, a
	key backer of Iraq in its war with Iran.
	    Henry Schuler, a former U.S. diplomat in the Middle East
	now with CSIS said Washington had agreed to escort Kuwaiti
	tankers in order to deter Iranian attacks on shipping.
	    But he said the deterrence policy had failed and the level
	of violence and threats to shipping had increased as a result
	of U.S. intervention and Iran's response.
	    The attack on the oil platform was the latest example of a
	U.S. "tit-for-tat" policy that gave Iran the initiative, said
	Harlan Ullman, an ex-career naval officer now with CSIS.
	    He said with this appraoch America would suffer "the death
	of one thousand cuts."
	    But for the United States to grab the initiative
	militarily, it must take warlike steps such as mining Iran's
	harbors or blockading the mouth of the Gulf through which its
	shipping must pass, Schuler said.
	    He was among those advocating mining as a means of bringing
	Iran to the neogtiating table. If vital supplies were cut off,
	Tehran could not continue the war with Iraq.
	    Ullman said Washington should join Moscow in a diplomatic
	initiative to end the war and the superpowers should impose an
	arms embargo against Tehran if it refused to negotiate.
	    He said the United States should also threaten to mine and
	blockade Iran if it continued fighting and must press Iraq to
	acknowledge responsibility for starting the war as part of a
	settlement.
	    Iranian and Western diplomats say Iraq started the war by
	invading Iran's territory in 1980. Iraq blames Iran for the
	outbreak of hostilities, which have entailed World War I-style
	infantry attacks resulting in horrific casualties.
	    Each side has attacked the others' shipping.
