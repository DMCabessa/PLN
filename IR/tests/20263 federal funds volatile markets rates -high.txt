	LONDON EURODOLLAR BONDS CLOSE LOWER
TOPICS:
	
PLACES:
	uk
CONTENT:
	Eurodollar bonds closed as much as a full
	point lower as the dollar fell to a post-war low against the
	yen and interest rates on U.S. Treasuries rose almost to eight
	pct.
	    The dollar fell to 144.30 yen and recovered only slightly
	after foreign exchange traders in New York said the Federal
	Reserve intervened to buy dollars for yen.
	    But despite the dollar's woes, Japan Development Bank,
	wholly owned by the Japanese government, raised 150 mln dlrs in
	a seven-year eurobond carrying an eight pct coupon.
	    Lead manager for the issue, Bank of Tokyo, said the deal,
	at the time of pricing, was to yield 60 basis points over
	comparable maturity Treasuries. However, by the close of
	trading, that spread had narrowed to 55 and continued to slide
	in aftermarket activity.
	    Dealers noted that the spread to Treasuries is wide for a
	newly-priced AAA-rated borrower like Japan Development Bank.
	For example, earlier this week, the World Bank raised U.S. Dlrs
	at only 25 basis points over Treasuries. Dealers said that
	because the borrower comes to market fairly infrequently -- the
	last time was about nine months ago, the spread appears wide.
	    But officials at Bank of Tokyo said the spread is intended
	to compensate for the lack of liquidity and for the uncertainty
	currently associated with owning dollar securities.
	    The officials said the borrower opted to raise funds in
	dollars, despite the currency's weakness, because it is the
	only market deep enough to accommodate an issue of that size.
	Japan Development Bank is not allowed to raise euroyen.
	    Market sources said the deal is likely to be swapped into
	yen as the borrowers previous issues were.
	    Late in the day, the deal was trading just inside its fees
	at less 1.75 less 1.55.
	    Also issued today was a 40 mln dlr five-year offering from
	Toshiba International Finance (Netherlands) carrying a 7-3/8
	pct coupon and priced at 101-1/2.
	    Three equity linked dollar denominated deals were offered,
	the largest of which was a 200 mln dlr offering by Sekisui
	Chemical Co and guaranteed by Sanwa Bank Ltd. The issue has
	equity warrants attached and late in the day it was quoted on
	brokers' screens at 106-1/2, bid only.
	    The Australian dollar market continued active, with
	Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce offering a bond of 125 mln
	five-year with a zero coupon priced at 54.
	    Late in the day, the deal was quoted at less 1-1/4 bid. A
	similar deal yesterday by Toronto Dominion, priced slightly
	higher at 54.37 pct for an effective yield of 13.52 pct, was
	quoted slightly lower at less 1.37 less 1.25 pct.
	    Dealers said that investors are apparently willing to
	accept zero-coupon bonds yielding 50 to 100 basis points less
	than annual-pay bonds because their are tax benefits for retail
	buyers. Also, the bonds are more volatile and if interest rates
	fall in Australia as many analysts expect, the potential for
	capital gains is greater with a zero-coupon. The bonds are also
	better for those who expect the australian dlr to appreciate.
	    Dealers said that the Australia dlr zero coupon bonds are
	apparently being placed with retail accounts on the European
	continent with very little placement being done in Japan.
	    Euroyen issues sank slightly in line with prices on
	domestic Japanese bond markets but recovered in late trade as
	the yen soared. After the markets closed, the dollar fell to
	144 yen.
	    The European Investment Bank (EIB) issued a 40 mln euroyen
	issue paying 4-5/8 pct over seven years. This is the second
	seven-year yen issue in two days -- a sector of the yield curve
	in Japan that dealers feel has not yet become overpriced.

	NYSE CHAIRMAN SAYS MARKET DECLINE NOT A CRASH
TOPICS:
	
PLACES:

CONTENT:
	New York Stock Exchange chairman John
	Phelan said the stock market underwent a significant correction
	today but he did not characterize it as a crash. He also said
	the NYSE will open tomorrow on time.
	    "The market underwent a significant fall and a significant
	devaluation of assets of which we are all concerned," he said.
	    Speaking to reporters, Phelan listed several reasons why
	the market fell today. He said stocks have been going up for
	five years without a correction. He also blamed inflation
	fears, rising interest rates, a lower dollar and problems with
	Iran. "All came together in a very nervous market" he said.
	    "It's the nearest thing to a meltdown that I ever want to
	see," Phelan said. Phelan said what he meant by meltdown was a
	snowballing effect where selling fed on itself.
	    Phelan said the NYSE is going through its standard
	procedures before trading begins tomorrow. Those procedures
	include checking with member firms on their liquidity, margin
	positions, and backlog. "We know of no firm that has a
	significant problem, but that could change at any moment," he
	said.
	    Asked for advice for the average investor, Phelan said, "We
	do not know where the market will end up."
	    The Dow Jones Industrial average declined a record 508
	points to 1738.74. Volume was a record setting 605 mln shares,
	almost double the previous record.
	    Phelan, in response to a question on declines in foreign
	markets, said he believes there is no loss of confidence in the
	global economy. He added that the underlying fundamentals of
	the U.S. economy are still strong, and that corporate earnings
	also continue to be firm.
	    Phelan explained today's record descent as being the result
	of a confluence of factors, including the globalization of
	markets and the proliferation of new securities instruments.
	    Those two factors alone have made the market more volatile,
	he said.
	    Phelan also said a major factor in the decline was the fact
	that there has been no major correction in the five-year bull
	market. He also pointed to rising tension in the Mideast Gulf.
	    The New York Stock Exchange was in constant contact with
	the Securities and Exchange Commission about a possible halt in
	all trading on the exchange, Phelan said. "The consensus was
	that it is better to let the market try to work itself out," he
	said.
	    In addition, Phelan said that with the global nature of
	trading there is no guarantee that halting trading on the New
	York Stock Exchange would have served any purpose. Phelan said
	he was in contact with the Treasury department, White House and
	the Federal Reserve, but that the contact was made as a matter
	of routine.

	ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - EMS MARKS EIGHTH BIRTHDAY
TOPICS:

CONTENT:
	The European Monetary System marks its
	eighth anniversary still vulnerable to turmoil in world money
	markets despite creating an island of currency rate stability
	in Europe, economists say. But many economists say the system,
	which holds eight European Community currencies within narrow
	fluctuation bands, remains in its infancy.
	    Its new currency, the European Currency Unit (Ecu), has
	been a runaway success with investors and borrowers alike
	seeking an alternative to the volatile dollar.
	    And on Wednesday, the long term vision of the Ecu as
	Europe's common currency took a step nearer to becoming reality
	when Belgium minted the world's first Ecu coin.
	    But economists say members such as West Germany have so far
	blocked a second stage of development envisaged by the system's
	founding fathers, ex-West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and
	former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing.
	    Under this phase, originally due to have started two years
	after the EMS was set up, decision-making was to have been
	transferred from national governments and central banks to an
	autonomous European Monetary Fund.
	    But members have jealously guarded their sovereignty in
	economic and monetary matters. "The basic problem of the EMS is
	that governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to a
	situation where certain decisions are taken in common," said one
	economist who has closely watched the system's development.
	    The result is that the EC is often divided over policy on
	third currencies, accentuating what the economists say is the
	system's greatest weakness, its vulnerability to a weak dollar.
	    Over the past 18 months, as the U.S. Dollar plunged and
	investors moved into strong currencies, the resulting sharp
	rise of the West German mark severely strained the system.
	    Another frustration has been Britain's failure to lend the
	EMS political support by keeping the pound, still a major world
	currency, outside the system.
	    No change in the British government's attitude is expected
	before the country's next general elections, due by mid-1988.
	    Meanwhile, the system's last realignment, the 11th since it
	was set up, prompted European finance ministers to ask the EC's
	highly-secretive Monetary Committee and Committee of Central
	Bank Governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it.
	    Their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministers
	hold an informal meeting in Belgium early next month.
	    But economists said the proposals are unlikely to involve
	more than tinkering with technical details. They are sceptical
	about the chances for any fundamental change.
	    "Technical measures won't be enough to protect the EMS
	against external factors such as dollar weakness. For that we
	must take the step forward to the institutional level," said Leo
	de Corel of Kredietbank's economic research department.
	    Economists say the system's fortunes now will depend
	largely on the success of an agreement last month among major
	industrial nations to stabilise exchange rates. If the dollar
	resumes its slide the EMS could be in for more turbulence, they
	predict.

	U.S. PRICE DATA SUGGEST MODERATE INFLATION
TOPICS:
	cpi
PLACES:
	usa
CONTENT:
	Latest consumer price data indicate
	U.S. inflation will be moderate in 1987 even though it will be
	above last year's pace, economists said.
	    "Inflation is not such a constructive factor as this time
	last year, but it's not building up a large head of steam,"
	said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp.
	    U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the consumer price
	index for all urban consumers, rose a seasonally adjusted 0.4
	pct in February after a 0.7 pct January gain. Energy prices,
	which fired January's data with a three pct rise, advanced a
	more moderate 1.9 pct last month.
	    The CPI came within the range of economists' expectations
	and had little direct impact on U.S. financial markets.
	    Among the key components of the report, transportation
	prices rose 0.5 pct in February after a 1.5 pct January gain
	reflecting smaller price appreciation for motor fuels and
	declines in new car prices and finance charges.
	    "There are no pronounced pressures at the retail level,"
	said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
	    Economists said the latest CPI supports existing
	expectations for an inflation rate of 3.5 to four pct in 1987.
	    The CPI rose 1.1 pct from December 1985 to December 1986.
	Without last year's energy price drop, it rose 3.8 pct.
	    Economists said that upward pressure on import prices as a
	result of the dollar's drop as well as the volatile energy
	component warrant attention in case gains in these areas become
	factored into the wider economic picture.
	    "As long as those price rises do not become entrenched in
	cost of living adjustments contained in labor contracts, thus
	reducing international competitiveness, then the Federal
	Reserve would probably be willing to tolerate four pct
	inflation," said Larry Leuzzi of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc.

	SINGAPORE BANKS SAY DIVERSIFICATION KEY TO GROWTH
TOPICS:

PLACES:

CONTENT:
	Singapore's major banks are
	diversifying and gradually shifting their asset holdings from
	loans to debt instruments, banking sources said.
	    The banks following the trend are the <Overseas Union Bank
	Ltd>, <United Overseas Bank Ltd>, <Oversea-Chinese Banking
	Corporation> and the <Development Bank of Singapore Ltd>.
	    The shift towards securitisation has been helped by
	volatile financial markets which have developed hedging
	facilities such as floating rate notes and bonds for risk
	management, said Overseas Union General Manager Loh Hoon Sun.
	    Loh told Reuters in an interview that Singapore banks see
	limited growth in credit risk. More and more of them are
	switching from term lending to major growth areas such as
	stockbroking and fee based income, he said.
	    Major local banks ventured into stockbroking after being
	granted seats on the stock exchange. Bankers said they are now
	moving into the new government securities market and the Stock
	Exchange of Singapore Dealing and Quotation System.
	    One foreign banker said the Development Bank and the
	Overseas Union Bank Ltd have become major players in the equity
	market in Singapore.
	    Loh said the banks' participation in the stock market has
	increased business transactions and provided long term growth
	for the market. The banks are not competition for individual
	stockbroking firms because of the increased business they
	generate, he added.
	    Loh said the Stock Exchange of Singapore might expand
	equity issues by as much as one billion dlrs this year because
	of the increasing ability of foreign and local market
	participants to absorb new issues.
	    Loh said <OUB Investment management Ltd>, a subsidiary of
	the Overseas Union Bank Ltd, has teamed up with a U.K. Firm to
	launch the Union Global Fund. The fund is for local investors
	seeking capital growth through a diversified international
	portfolio. It will invest in international shares with the
	emphasis on U.S. And Japanese markets, he said.
	    <DBS Securities Singapore Pte Ltd>, a subsidiary of the
	Development Bank of Singapore, has applied to the Hong Kong
	Stock Exchange to set up a Hong Kong stockbroking firm.
	    Loh predicted fixed deposit and prime interest rates in
	Singapore will stay low this year. As a result, banks will be
	forced to provide fund management services for major clients
	seeking better returns, he said.
	    Economic analysts and bankers are optimistic the major
	banks will show profits in 1987, helped by higher income from
	treasury and investment banking activities.
	    They expect the 1987 after-tax profits of Oversea-Chinese
	and United Overseas to show stable growth of four to eight pct
	against respective gains of four and seven pct in 1986.
	    Overseas Union's profits are expected to jump to over 40
	mln dlrs from seven mln dlrs in 1986, economists said.
	    The Development Bank's after-tax profits rose 39.2 pct in
	1986 mainly due to a dividend of 20.4 mln dlrs paid by
	<National Discount Company Ltd> before it became a subsidiary
	of the bank, they said.

	ANALYSTS SEE SLOW MOVE TO HIGHER U.S. PRIME RATE
TOPICS:
	interest
PLACES:
	usa
CONTENT:
	Quarter-point prime rate increases to
	7-3/4 pct by Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank today will be
	followed by other banks only after they see clearer signs of
	the Federal Reserve's policy intentions, economists said.
	    "Based on the spread between banks' cost of funds and the
	prime rate, it probably makes sense for others to follow, but
	no rush is likely," said Paul McCulley of E.F. Hutton and Co.
	    Citibank's surprise base rate increase, quickly followed by
	Chase, sent U.S. bond prices lower and the dollar higher.
	    McCulley said that once the spread between three-month
	certificates of deposit and the prime rate narrows to less than
	1-1/2 percentage points, there is a strong chance of a prime
	rate increase. It has been under 1-1/4 points recently.
	    However, banks are likely to hold rate increases until they
	see what the Fed intends to do about interest rates in the near
	term, analysts said. They noted that banks historically like to
	follow Fed rate movements, rather than lead them. For example,
	the last prime rate increase occurred in June 1984 when banks
	lifted the rate to 13 pct from 12-1/2 pct after a Fed discount
	rate increase in April of that year.
	    Major banks had been posting a 7-1/2 pct prime rate since
	last August 26/27, when they lowered the rate from eight pct
	shortly after the Fed's half-point discount rate cut to the
	current 5-1/2 pct level on August 20.
	    "The banks will not rush to raise their prime rates. There
	should be a split prime for a while with some posting a 7-1/2
	pct rate and others 7-3/4 pct," said David Jones of Aubrey G.
	Lanston and Co.
	    Jones said the Federal Open Market Committee at today's
	meeting voted no change in Fed policy. But he said the Fed may
	well foster higher interest rates soon.
	    Jones said that, while the FOMC probably voted no policy
	change today, it may have decided to apply slight upward rate
	pressure later if the dollar weakens, inflation pressures heat
	up or the economy shows sign of strong recovery.
	    "The Fed clearly indicated that they did not intend to
	tighten policy when they did today's coupon pass," said Joseph
	Liro of S.G. Warburg and Co.
	    In a move that came a day earlier than most expected, the
	Fed today supplied permanent reserves to the banking system by
	offering to buy all maturities of Treasury notes and bonds for
	its own account. This seasonal reserve add is called a "pass."
	    "The Fed demonstrated that there has been no policy
	change," said Elizabeth Reiners, economist at Dean Witter
	Reynolds Inc. 
	    She said the spread between banks' cost of funds and the
	prime rate is now around 137 basis points compared with a 153
	basis point average in 1986. Reiners said the spread is not
	really narrow enough to present a clear need for a prime rate
	increase.
	    The Dean Witter economist said that today's prime rate rise
	"may have been less a response to interest rates than an
	attempt to enhance the (balance sheet) bottom line."
	    Reiners said that, given recent problems with loans to
	developing countries, large money center banks with heavy
	exposures might be the first to match the higher prime rate in
	an effort to get more profitable spreads on other loans.
	    The Federal funds rate at which banks lend overnight money
	to one another could help determine how many banks match the
	higher prime rate and also how quickly they move.
	    In raising their prime rates, banks cited a higher cost of
	funds. In the three business days through Monday, the Federal
	funds rate at which banks lend to one another averaged nearly
	6-1/4 pct. But quarter end pressures helped push up funds.  
	    The Fed funds rate was extremely volatile today, reflecting
	demand pressure associated with the end of the quarter and the
	close of the Japanese fiscal year. Funds traded between five
	and 6-3/4 pct.
	    Once the special distortions end, analysts said the funds
	rate probably will return to its recent trading level in the
	6-1/8 pct area. They said that, if it stabilizes near there,
	banks may not quickly boost their prime rates.
	    But a consistently higher funds rates would suggest to many
	that the Fed was fostering somewhat higher interest rates to
	help the dollar. Then banks would lift prime rates quickly.

	TRIPLE-EXPIRATION MAY JOLT STOCK MARKET
TOPICS:
	
PLACES:
	usa
CONTENT:
	The stock market could be jolted one
	way or another on Friday as the so-called triple witching
	expiration raises the specter of volatile movement.
	    The Dow Jones Industrial Average could soar or plunge as
	much as 100 points, or both, or even remain static, according
	to analysts of the stock and stock index futures markets.
	    The simultaneous expiration of March stock index futures
	contracts, options on these futures and options on the indexes
	themselves, along with options on individual stocks, has
	created a mad scramble during several previous "witching
	hours."
	    Upon expiration of these vehicles, investment managers must
	find a place for their funds, and in the past the final hour
	has seen a tremendous surge in New York Stock Exchange volume.
	    Analysts said the overriding influence of the stock
	market's steady climb this year -- and the absence of
	worthwhile investment alternatives -- may indicate that the
	major players will look to buy into the stock market as the
	final hour transpires this friday.
	    "I think there will be a substantial swap out of futures
	(positions) and into stocks," Jeffrey Miller, of Miller Tabak
	Hirsch and Co said. "(But) I've got a streak of four or five in
	a row of being right, so I'm bound to be wrong."
	    The feeling among some analysts is that the largest money
	managers will do the same thing they did at December's
	expiration when they plunged their multi-billion dollar funds
	into the stock market.
	    "Last time, during triple-expiration, there was a
	tremendous amount of stock sold, which was offset by huge buy
	programs late," said Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette Inc analyst
	William Marcus.
	    Some stock funds quickly place newly arrived investment
	dollars into buying futures positions, Miller said. Then, upon
	the expiration of the futures, the manager looks to transform
	that into a stock portfolio, he said.
	    The coming month is also a seasonally strong period for the
	stock market, Stotler and Co analyst David Hightower said,
	because of the influx of income tax refunds.
	    Although Hightower recommended steering clear of trading
	during the witching hour, he suggested buying if the market
	plunges, believing that the slide would only be temporary.
	    Marcus said it was difficult to make a prediction as to
	which way the market will go on Friday, partly because many
	investors will be engaging in "window-dressing."
	    The public disclosure of order imbalances in individual
	stocks a half hour before the close may reveal an opportunity
	to those investors seeking either to buy or get rid of stocks,
	offsetting whatever impact the initial imbalances show.
	    Analysts said efforts by exchanges to quell the volatility
	on triple-expirations are unlikely to substantially alter the
	impact of futures and options on the stock market. Money
	managers are sure to find other types of loopholes that emerge
	under the new rules, they said.

	    There has recently been much speculation that the Japanese
	would look towards the U.K. Stock market for investment
	opportunities on a much larger scale when the new fiscal year
	begins next month. Last October's reorganisation of the stock
	market, known as 'Big Bang', paved the way for greater
	participation by overseas investors.
	    Some analysts believe the Japanese have earmarked massive
	sums for investment in Europe.
	    Both the London and Tokyo markets have moved ahead strongly
	since the start of this year. But London has lagged behind in
	real terms and therefore is now beginning to look like giving a
	better return on any funds that are reserved for equity
	investment. Sterling's firmness also means there are profits to
	be made from the currency turn. However, many equity dealers
	polled by Reuters think that the Japanese will shy away from
	London and continue to invest in instruments such as U.S.
	Government securities.
	    Even if they do diversify from their old stamping grounds
	they will head for the U.S. Equity market before they come to
	the European stock markets, one dealer predicted.
	    "The Japanese, although very aggressive in markets that they
	know, tend to be more conservative in those they don't...Even
	if they do come to London in a big way they would tend to go
	more for the fixed interest gilt edged market rather than the
	more volatile equities," he added.
	    He also cited the forthcoming U.K. General election as
	another factor in keeping Far Eastern money out of the London
	stock market.
	    "The Japanese do not like too much uncertainty and a general
	election creates just the kind that will keep them on the
	sidelines," one trader said.
	    There are also doubts whether the Japanese would find the
	track records of U.K. Companies strong enough to make them
	willing to invest heavily. "Our industrial and manufacturing
	output may be looking better, but it must still look pretty
	uninspiring to the Japanese," one broker said.
	    Some market participants, however, are a little more
	bullish and do expect more, although not a massive amount, of
	Far Eastern funds to come to London in the short term.
	    They point out that capital gains on U.S. Bonds, a market
	in which the Japanese are traditionally heavy players, have
	been eroded because of the fall in the U.S. Dollar and this
	could prompt them to move funds out of the U.S. But even those
	who are mildly bullish concede that Japanese investors on the
	London exchange would almost certainly confine themselves to
	longer term investment in 10 or 15 leading 'blue chip' issues,
	which may include industrial giants such as ICI, Hanson Trust,
	British Petroleum, Glaxo and Unilever.
	    One analyst said he believed if there was such investment
	in blue chip issues, recently privatised companies such as
	British Gas and British Telecom could be left out in the cold.
	    He said that with an election coming up, overseas investors
	would be worried that a Labour victory would bring a policy of
	re-nationalisation of such companies. The Labour party has in
	the past said it would do this.
	    Some of the recent rise in U.K. Equities has anticipated an
	increase in Japanese buying in the near future.

	RUBBER PRODUCERS, CONSUMERS START NEW PACT TALKS
TOPICS:

CONTENT:
	The chairman of the conference on a new
	International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA), Manaspas Xuto of
	Thailand, said it was imperative to try to settle the main
	outstanding issues this week.
	    The INRA renegotiation conference, which resumed today
	under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade
	and Development (UNCTAD), is scheduled to last until March 20.
	    Xuto told delegates this session of the conference
	presented a promising opportunity to conclude a new pact but it
	had to be the last before the current accord expires in
	October.
	    Xuto said in his consultations with representatives of
	major exporting and importing countries over the last few
	months, "I have found a constructive attitude and willingness to
	be flexible on the part of all concerned."
	    "It is imperative that we try to settle the major
	outstanding issues in the course of this week, since a
	considerable amount of technical drafting work will remain to
	be completed." He said he will immediately start consultations
	with producers and consumers.
	    The last October negotiations collapsed in disagreement
	over buffer stock operations.
	    Consumer demands for tighter buffer stock controls, aimed
	at preventing INRA from following the collapse of the
	International Tin Agreement (ITA), were rejected by producers
	who argued for unchanged INRA terms.
	    The tin pact failed when its buffer stock manager ran out
	of funds to support prices.
	    Three previous rounds of talks between rubber producers and
	consumers for a new five-year pact ended without agreement. The
	INRA, originally due to expire in October 1985, was extended to
	October 1987 to facilitate renegotiation.
	    Wong Kum Choon, head of the Malaysian delegation, said he
	was cautiously optimistic "that together we should be able to
	save INRA and prevent it from being scuttled."
	    Without INRA, he added, prices of natural rubber would
	become more volatile.
	    Calling on delegates to show a sense of purpose and
	reality, he said, "There is no reason why we could not put aside
	differences and come up with a successor agreement."

	SENIOR ECONOMIST PREDICTS 30 PCT FALL IN DOLLAR

CONTENT:
	a senior economist predicted the
	u.s. dollar would decline another 30 pct by year-end, but said
	he foresees no significant change in u.s. interest rates.
	    "the market recognizes another 30 pct dollar depreciation is
	necessary," said rudiger dornbush of the massachusetts institute
	of technology.
	    he said the only thing preventing the dollar from dropping
	far below current levels was intervention by central banks in
	definace of market forces.
	    he said artifical support of the dollar had put the world's
	financial markets in an "excessively volatile" position, however,
	and predicted that within about four months "it is going to be
	very difficult to keep the dollar in place."
	    the forecasts, dornbush added, are for "a steady
	deterioration from now on."
	    dornbush, a university of chicago-educated economist, works
	with the national bureau of economic research as well as mit.
	he spoke here at the invitation of panama's national banking
	association, sponsor of a three-day international banking
	convention that got under way yesterday.
	    dornbush discarded fears of soaring u.s. interest rates
	because of the declining dollar.
	    "the u.s. cannot raise interest rates. if it raises interest
	rates all the debts will bounce in the foreign sector ... and
	all over latin america," he said.

	U.S. DATA POINT TO CAPITAL SPENDING SLOWDOWN
TOPICS:
	
PLACES:
	usa
CONTENT:
	A surprise 7.5 pct drop in U.S. January
	durable goods orders points to a slowdown in capital spending
	that could presage lackluster real growth in the U.S. economy
	in the first quarter of 1987, economists said.
	    With total orders, excluding the volatile defense sector,
	falling a record 9.9 pct, economists agreed that the report
	painted a bleak picture for the U.S. economy.
	    But they stressed that the 1987 tax reform laws may be a
	primary factor behind the drop in orders for business capital
	investment.
	    "It's a rather gloomy outlook for the economy, said David
	Wyss of Data Resources Inc. "I'm particularly impressed by the
	19.7 pct drop in non-defense capital goods orders because it
	may be a sign that businesses are reacting more adversely to
	tax reform than we thought."
	    The Commerce Department pointed out that a record 14.8 pct
	decline in new orders for machinery was led by declines in
	office and computing equipment orders.
	    Economists said the drop in computer orders may have been a
	response to the lengthening of depreciation schedules and the
	end of the investment tax credit under the new tax laws.
	    "It's more expensive to invest than it used to be, so
	people just aren't doing it as much," Wyss said.
	     Increases in durable goods orders at year's end reinforced
	the view that businesses anticipated the changing tax laws,
	economists said.
	    November durable goods orders rose 5.1 pct and December's
	increased 1.5 pct, revised upwards from a previously reported
	0.9 pct.
	    But most acknowledged that the huge January drop was caused
	by more than tax reform.
	    "The wash-out that took place in January was far greater
	than the actual gains that took place in November and
	December," said Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "The
	economy has a weakening bent to it early in the year."
	    "The report definitely points to very sluggish capital
	spending over the next couple of quarters," said Donald Maude
	of Midland Montagu Capital Markets Inc.
	    Maude pointed to a continuing decline in order backlogs as
	evidence that the outlook for new orders is not improving. In
	November, order backlogs rose 0.6 pct, but in December they
	fell 0.6 pct and in January 0.7 pct, he said.
	    "It suggests orders in the pipeline are depleting, which
	may quickly translate to a drop in production," Midland
	Montagu's Maude said.
	    Wyss cautioned that too much should not be made of
	January's report, given that other reports have reflected
	strength.
	    But he acknowledged that the decline occurred despite a 51
	pct rise in defense orders, compared with a 57.7 pct decline in
	December.
	    He also noted that there was a 6.9 pct drop in January
	shipments, compared with a 5.4 pct rise in December.
	    "Given these numbers, there's no reason for the Fed to
	tighten," Data Resources' Wyss said.
	    "But there's no reason to ease unless we see more numbers
	like this. The Fed will wait and see," he added.
	    Sullivan predicted the Fed will ease by Easter. "People
	aren't talking recession or Fed easing now, but the Fed will
	have to ease to ensure global growth."
