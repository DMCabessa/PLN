	JAPAN CANNOT BEAR FURTHER YEN RISE, MINISTER SAYS

CONTENT:
	Japan cannot bear a further rise of the
	yen, Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari said.
	    "A further stronger yen would be a misfortune for Japan and
	the Japanese people would not be able to bear such a burden," he
	told reporters.
	    The minister said he wants to tell U.S. Political leaders
	of the sacrifices Japan is making to cut its trade surplus.
	    Kuranari was widely expected to fly to Washington tomorrow
	for talks focussing on trade. But departure remains uncertain
	because of the continuing parliamentary boycott by opposition
	parties protesting plans for a new sales tax.
	    If the boycott is lifted tomorrow, Kuranari would probably
	have to remain in Japan to attend parliamentary discussions on
	the government's 1987/88 budget, Japanese officials said.
	    Kuranari said both the U.S. And Japan should approach the
	trade imbalance in a calm, unemotional manner.
	    But, he added, "If the issue of rice is to be raised...I
	would mention the feelings of the Japanese people."
	    Japanese politicians have said repeatedly the country
	cannot bow to U.S. Pressure to liberalize rice imports because
	the issue is too sensitive.

	SRI LANKAN MINISTER SEES SLOWEST GROWTH IN DECADE
TOPICS:

PLACES:

CONTENT:
	Civil strife in Sri Lanka will
	make the economy's growth rate in 1987 its slowest in a decade,
	Sri Lankan finance minister Ronnie de Mel said here.
	    He told Reuters in an interview that he expected gross
	domestic product to expand by only four pct in 1987. He said it
	averaged five pct over the past three years.
	    For the first two years after the present troubles began in
	1983, production of key commodities like tea, rubber, coconuts
	and rice kept up, he said.
	    Tamils on the island are fighting for a seperate state.
	    De Mel said: "Private sector production in fact grew by 25
	pct in 1984 and 20 pct in 1985. But last year things took a
	turn for the worse."
	    He said prices of tea, the main export, fell to half their
	1984 levels. World prices of rubber and copra also fell.
	    "There was also a decline in income from tourism and
	remittances from Sri Lankans working in the Middle East."
	    He said any savings from the worldwide drop in crude oil
	prices were wiped out by the cut in commodity earnings.
	    "To add to all this we have had, between January and March
	this year, the worst drought I have seen in my life," he said.
	    De Mel said the drought would seriously affect agricultural
	production.
	    He said because of the fighting in the country, defence
	expenditure was now about 20 pct of the national 1987 budget of
	70 billion rupees.
	    Sri Lanka planned to borrow about 600 mln dlrs in 1987 from
	the World Bank and the Sri Lanka Aid Consortium which comprises
	members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
	Development (OECD), he said.
	    "We also plan to ask the International Monetary Fund for
	another 200 mln dlrs through a structural adjustment facility
	and a compensatory financing facility to balance our export
	revenue cuts," de Mel said.
	    He said despite the unrest, Sri Lanka had succeeded in
	keeping its total foreign debt to three billion dlrs by
	avoiding borrowing from commercial banks.
	    "Commercial bank debt accounts for only 15 pct of our total
	foreign debt," he said.
	    He said the Mahaweli hydro-electric project was nearing
	completion. It was likely to cut dependence on oil imports.
	    "The project will more than treble our hydro-electric power
	from 300 megawatts to nearly 1,000 megawatts," de Mel said.
	    He said 20 new townships would rise around the project,
	which is in the north-central part of the island. It was
	expected to irrigate 1.2 mln acres of land and indirectly
	provide employment for 500,000 landless families.
	    De Mel said Tamil guerrillas were waging a war of attrition
	in the island's north and east.

	INDONESIAN AGRICULTURE GROWTH EXPECTED TO SLOW

PLACES:

CONTENT:
	Indonesia"s agriculture sector will grow
	by just 1.0 pct in calendar 1987, against an estimated 2.4 pct
	in 1986 as the production of some commodities stagnates or
	declines, the U.S. Embassy said in a report.
	    Production of Indonesia"s staple food, rice, is forecast to
	fall to around 26.3 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of
	26.58 mln tonnes in 1986, according to the annual report on
	Indonesia"s agricultural performance.
	    The government officially estimates 1986 rice production at
	26.7 mln tonnes, with a forecast 27.3 mln tonnes output in
	1987.
	    The report says wheat imports are likely to fall to 1.5 mln
	tonnes in calendar 1987 from 1.69 mln tonnes in 1986 because of
	a drawdown on stocks.
	    "Growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not look
	promising as rice production is forecast to decline and the
	production of sugarcane, rubber and copra show little or no
	gain," the report says.
	    "The modest overall increase which is expected will be due
	to significant gains in production of corn soybeans, palm oil
	and palm kernels."
	    Constraints to significant overall increases in
	agricultural output include a shortage of disease resistant
	seeds, limited fertile land, insect pests and a reluctance by
	farmers to shift from rice production to other crops, the
	report underlines.
	    The fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak of
	pests known as "wereng" or brown plant hoppers in 1986 which
	largely offset gains in yields.
	    The outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57
	insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are now
	resistant to these varieties, and to use lower-yielding, more
	resistant rice types.
	    The government is depending on increased production of
	export commodities such as coffee, tea, rubber, plywood and
	palm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crude
	oil prices.
	    Palm oil production is expected to increase by over 7.0 pct
	in 1987 to 1.45 mln tonnes from 1.35 mln, with exports rising
	to an estimated 720,000 tonnes from 695,000 tonnes in 1986, the
	report says.
	    But while production of soybeans in 1987/88 (Oct-Sept) will
	rise to 1.075 mln tonnes from 980,000 in 1986/87, imports will
	also rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant.
	    The report says that imports of wheat, soybeans, soybean
	meal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of last
	September"s 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a rise
	in domestic demand.
	    The report said that Indonesia"s overall economic
	performance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slight
	negative growth rate, the lowest rate of growth since the
	mid-1960s. It compares with 1.9 pct growth in 1985 and 6.7 pct
	in 1984.
	    The dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsible
	for the slump.

	PAKISTAN UNVEILS NEW TRADE POLICY TO BOOST EXPORTS
TOPICS:
	trade, grain, rice, cotton
PLACES:
	pakistan
CONTENT:
	Pakistani government allowed freer
	cotton and rice export in a three-year new trade policy aimed
	at narrowing the country's yawning trade gap.
	    Commerce and Planning Minister Mahbubul Haq said in a
	televised speech the government had also decided to allow
	duty-free import of cotton yarn to make the textile industry
	more competitive, and to link bulk tea imports to the export of
	Pakistani products.
	   
	    Cotton and rice are Pakistan's main exports, which have
	been handled exclusively by state corporations since early
	1970s.
	    But Haq said now the private sector would also export
	cotton and rice along with the corporations, which meets a
	long-standing demand of the local traders.
	    The duty-free import of cotton yarn has been allowed to
	bring down prices and help the local ancillary industries
	compete effectively in the world market, he said.
	   
	    Haq said the new policy, effective from the fiscal year
	1987/88 beginning on July 1, would be for three years but
	reviewed every year.
	    It was a departure from the previous practice of announcing
	trade policies for a single fiscal year, and Haq said it would
	enable the businessmen to plan their market strategies over a
	longer period.
	    He said an export credit of 250 mln dlrs had been provided
	for the export of engineering goods to selected third world
	countries on soft credit terms.
	   
	    Pakistan's 1986/87 exports at 3.6 billion dlrs, 18.2 per
	cent more than in the previous year, and imports at 5.23
	billion dlrs compared to 5.63 billion dlrs in 1985/86.
	    He said the government policy was to rationalise and
	streamline import controls.
	    "It has been observed that due to restrictions on imports,
	specially on raw materials and intermediate goods, local
	industry has been suffering for want of necessary inputs," he
	said. "Prices have been on the increase and quality of goods
	produced has been low. This restrictive policy also gave rise
	to smuggling and hampering of exports."
	   
	    He said that to correct this situation, 136 items had freed
	from import restrictions.
	    Previously, Pakistan has met its trade gap largely from
	remittances from its nationals working abroad, mainly in the
	Gulf. However, the remittances have begun to fall after the
	drop in oil prices in recent years leading to the spectre of a
	balance of payments crisis for Pakistan.

	JAPAN MINISTRY SAYS OPEN FARM TRADE WOULD HIT U.S.

	usa, japan, brazil, china, australia
CONTENT:
	Japan's Agriculture Ministry, angered by
	U.S. Demands that Japan open its farm products market, will
	tell U.S. Officials at talks later this month that
	liberalisation would harm existing U.S. Farm exports to Japan,
	a senior ministry official said.
	    "Imports from the U.S. Would drop due to active sales drives
	by other suppliers," the official, who declined to be named,
	said. "Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Farm products and
	it is not reasonable for the U.S. To demand Japan liberalise
	its farm import market," he said.
	    Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato has said if the U.S.
	Insists Japan open its protected rice market it will also open
	its wheat market, where volume and origin are regulated to
	protect local farmers.
	    Australia and Canada could then increase their wheat
	exports as they are more competitive than the U.S., He said.
	End-users would also buy other origins, grain traders said.
	    U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who is due to
	visit Japan for talks between April 16-27, has said he will ask
	Japan to offer a share of its rice market to U.S. Suppliers and
	remove quotas on U.S. Beef and citrus imports.
	    Other countries are already cutting into the U.S. Market
	share here. Australia, the largest beef supplier to Japan, has
	been trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-year
	beef accord next March 31.
	    Imports of U.S. Corn have fallen due to increased sales
	from China and South America, while Japanese soybean imports
	from Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year, although
	the U.S. Will remain the largest supplier.
	    U.S. Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up its
	beef imports, since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrain
	imports, mainly from the U.S., Japanese officials said.
	    An indication of the U.S. Position came last December when
	Under Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan has
	the potential to provide one of the largest boosts to U.S.
	Agricultural exports, with the beef market alone representing
	some one billion dlrs in new business.
	    The U.S. Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffs
	and Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese import
	controls on 12 other farm products, including fruit juices,
	purees and pulp, tomato juice, ketchup and sauce, peanuts,
	prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans.
	    To help calm heated trade relations with the U.S., Japan's
	top business group Keidanren has urged the government to remove
	residual import restrictions on agricultural products.
	    But Agriculture Minister Kato has ruled out any emotional
	reaction, and the senior ministry official said the farm issue
	should not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in the
	industrial sector.
	    "Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. Farm products, and these
	issues should not be discussed on the same table," the official
	said.

	Thailand's trade deficit widened to 4.5
	billion baht in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.1 billion a
	year ago, the Business Economics Department said.
	    It said Janunary/March imports rose to 65.1 billion baht
	from 58.7 billion. Thailand's improved business climate this
	year resulted in a 27 pct increase in imports of raw materials
	and semi-finished products.
	    The country's oil import bill, however, fell 23 pct in the
	first quarter due to lower oil prices.
	    The department said first quarter exports expanded to 60.6
	billion baht from 56.6 billion.
	    Export growth was smaller than expected due to lower
	earnings from many key commodities including rice whose
	earnings declined 18 pct, maize 66 pct, sugar 45 pct, tin 26
	pct and canned pineapples seven pct.
	    Products registering high export growth were jewellery up

	LYNG SETS TOUGH U.S. STANCE WITH JAPAN ON BEEF

CONTENT:
	U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard
	Lyng warned Japan that the failure to remove a longstanding 
	import quota on Japanese beef might spark a protectionist
	response in the United States.
	    "Given the protectionist mood in the Congress and the
	country, if I were a leader in Japan I would certainly be very
	concerned...and the failure to remove it (the beef quota) might
	be very serious," Lyng told a group of U.S cattlemen.
	    Lyng said he and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter,
	during a visit to Japan later this month, will demand "total
	elimination" of the beef import quota by April 1988.
	    The current dispute with Japan over semiconductor may
	strengthen the U.S. stance in farm trade negotiations, Lyng
	said, because Japan does not want a trade war with the U.S.
	    Lyng dismissed recent statements in Tokyo that Japan might
	retaliate against U.S. products as a result of the
	semiconductor dispute.
	    "They (Japan) aren't going to pick a fight with us," Lyng
	said, adding that with its huge bilateral trade surplus Japan
	has more to lose in a trade war than the United States.
	    Lyng told the U.S. cattlemen that the quota on Japanese
	beef imports does not allow consumers there an adequate choice
	in food purchases.
	    He said in addition to beef, the U.S. will press for
	eliminiation of import barriers on Japan's citrus and rice as
	well.
	    Lyng noted that Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. farm
	products, principally grains and soybeans.

	President Desmond Hoyte said recent
	reports of widespread thallium sulphate poisoning in Guyana
	were mischievous and had gravely damaged the country's food
	exports.
	    "There is no thallium sulphate poisoning epidemic in Guyana,
	as has been rumored," Hoyte said in a radio address late Sunday.
	    Reports of a spate of poisonings from the chemical had led
	some newspapers in the Caribbean to call for a ban on food
	exports from Guyana, and Trinidad and Tobago had restricted
	imports of Guyanese rice, Hoyte said.
	    Thallium sulphate, banned in many countries and blacklisted
	since 1973 by the World Health Organization as a deadly
	chemical, has been used by Guyana's state sugar corporation as
	a rodent poison.
	    Calling the reports a "mischievous invention," Hoyte said
	tests had shown some of Guyana's main exports, such as wheat
	and flour, were not contaminated.
	    Hoyte based his statements on tests conducted by the WHO
	and the Pan American Health Organization, which found only
	seven cases of thallium sulphate poisoning thus far.

TITLE:
	LYNG OPENS JAPAN TALKS ON FARM TRADE BARRIERS
TOPICS:
	trade, carcass, orange, rice
PLACES:
	usa, japan
CONTENT:
	U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng
	opens talks with Japanese government officials today well aware
	his demand for the opening of Japanese rice, beef and citrus
	markets is likely to be rejected.
	     But in an interview with Reuters during the flight to
	Tokyo yesterday, Lyng said the goal of his trip was to throw an
	international spotlight on Japan's agricultural import
	protection in the hope pressure would build on Tokyo to open
	its markets.
	    "(The Japanese) have said they are happy we are coming, but
	they are not going to give us anything," Lyng said.
	    U.S. Officials do not expect any Japanese concessions
	during Lyng's two-week visit here. Any farm trade concessions
	would be unveiled later this month, they said.
	    "If there is anything of consequence to offer (Prime
	Minister Yasuhiro) Nakasone would take it with him," when he
	visits Washington later in the month, one U.S. Official said.
	    Lyng plans to ask Japan to open the door to rice imports by
	partially lifting the longstanding ban on foreign purchases.
	    A private U.S. Rice trader visited Tokyo last week
	requesting Japan buy 200,000 tonnes of rice for industrial uses
	such as making sake. Japan has rejected the overture, saying
	Tokyo maintains a policy of self-sufficiency in rice.
	    Lyng will also press Japan to eliminate an import quota for
	beef by April 1988 because he believes Japanese consumers would
	like to buy much more beef than currently allowed.
	    He cited the example of a California company which
	transports live U.S. Cattle to Japan by air for slaughter to
	circumvent the beef quota. The cost of transport is higher than
	the value of the animal, he said.
	    U.S. Officials said the Japan Livestock Industry Promotion
	Corporation which regulates beef imports, was forced to borrow
	from the fiscal 1987 quota earlier this year because the 1986
	quota was exhausted and Japanese beef prices were rising. Japan
	has said it cannot open its markets to beef imports.
	    Along with beef, the U.S. Will also press Japan to
	eliminate import quotas on fresh oranges and orange juice by
	April, 1988. Some U.S. Officials believe Japan may eventually
	be willing to scrap the quota on fresh oranges because
	liberalized trade would not necessarily damage the Japanese
	mandarin orange industry.
	    The quota on juice may be harder to eliminate because
	imports might replace domestic produced juice, U.S. And
	Japanese officials have said.
	   Lyng has resurrected a past U.S. Proposal that Japan buy
	surplus U.S. Foodgrains for donation to developing countries,
	but some U.S. Officials are skeptical action will be taken.
	   Lyng will also urge Japan to put its domestic farm policies,
	including rice, on the negotiating table during GATT talks in
	Geneva. He said Japan must eliminate import quotas on certain
	minor food products or face possible U.S. Reprisals.

	CHINA TO IMPORT MORE GRAIN IN 1987
TOPICS:
	grain
PLACES:
	china
CONTENT:
	China's grain imports will rise
	in 1987 because of a serious drought and increasing demand, but
	will be not be as large as in the past, Chinese officials and
	Japanese traders told Reuters.
	    They said foreign exchange constraints and national policy
	would not allow a return to large-scale imports, which peaked
	at 16.15 mln tonnes in 1982.
	    An agricultural official of the Shanghai government put
	maximum imports at about 10 mln tonnes this year, against 7.73
	mln in 1986 and 5.97 mln in 1985.
	    Officials said grain imports rose in 1986 because of a poor
	harvest and rising domestic demand, but remained below exports,
	which rose to 9.42 mln tonnes from 9.33 mln in 1985.
	    "China is short of foreign exchange," the Shanghai official
	said. "We cannot rely on imports, even at current low world
	prices. Only if there is a major disaster will we become a
	major importer."
	    A Japanese trader in Peking said Chinese grain imports
	would rise and exports fall this year because of the drought,
	low world prices and rising domestic demand for human and
	animal consumption.
	    "At current prices, China loses yuan on every tonne of grain
	it exports, though it earns foreign exchange which it badly
	needs," the trader said.
	    The People's Daily said last Saturday a serious drought is
	affecting 13.3 mln hectares of arable land, which will reduce
	the summer grain harvest from last year's level.
	    The paper added that leaders in some areas were not paying
	enough attention to agriculture, especially grain, making it
	difficult to achieve the 1987 grain output target of 405 mln
	tonnes against 391 mln in 1986.
	    "All areas must spare no effort to raise the autumn harvest
	area, especially of corn, sweet potatoes, paddy rice and
	high-yield cash crops," it said.
	    It added factory production might have to be reduced to
	provide electricity for agriculture if it was needed to fight
	the drought.
	    Since January, the press has devoted much attention to
	grain, stressing that growth in output is vital to China's
	economic and political stability and that prices paid to
	farmers are too low.
	    Officials in east China have repeatedly said stable grain
	production is a key state policy and outlined the measures
	being taken in their areas to encourage output.
	    The Shanghai official said that in one suburb, 10 pct of
	the pre-tax profits of factories are used to subsidise
	agriculture. He said rural industries in other suburbs also set
	aside money for grain and pay the salaries of some of the
	70,000 workers available to help farmers.
	    Chu Jinfeng, an official of Fengbing county outside
	Shanghai, said factory workers get 60 yuan a month and three
	years unpaid leave to grow grain and can keep the profits.
	    Pan Huashan, an official of the agricultural department of
	Zhejiang Province, said rural industry also subsidises grain
	output in his province.
	    "In addition, we are setting up grain production bases,
	raising the level of science and technology on the farms and
	improving the supply of raw materials, roads and other
	infrastructure," he said.
	    The Shanghai official said rural residents who work in
	industry or commerce usually keep their land to farm in their
	spare time, or let other family members farm it. In some cases,
	they lease the land to grain farmers.
	    The China Daily said last month that grain output should
	reach between 425 and 450 mln tonnes by 1990 and between 480
	and 500 mln by 2000. It said growing grain should be made
	profitable.
	    "The advantages the state promises grain growers actually
	yield tangible profits for them and are not siphoned off by
	intermediate agencies because of bureaucracy or corruption.
	Only this will boost enthusiasm," it said.

	MADAGASCAR RICE CROP ESTIMATED HIGHER IN 1987

	Madagascar's vital rice crop is

	    The Trade Ministry said rice imports quadrupled in local
	currency value during the first nine months of last year as the
	government established a buffer stock of the country's staple
	food.
	    Rice imports increased to 82.4 billion Malagasy francs

	DENG SETS LIMIT TO CHINA GRAIN IMPORTS, PAPER SAYS

CONTENT:
	China's top leader Deng Xiaoping said
	China must not import more than 10 mln tonnes of grain, Ming
	Pao newspaper of Hong Kong said.
	    Customs figures show that China imported 7.73 mln tonnes of
	grain in 1986, up from 5.97 mln in 1985 but down from a record
	16.15 mln in 1982.
	    The newspaper quoted Deng as saying that grain output is
	one of several key issues that will influence the whole
	development of the economy. It did not give the context of his
	remarks. The 1987 grain production target is 405 mln, up from
	391 mln in 1986.
	    The newspaper quoted Deng as saying that the situation has
	reached the point where "pigs are not fed, there is not enough
	grain and increases in output have slowed."
	    "We should in our overall economic planning put agriculture
	in its proper place to reach our target of 480 mln tonnes by
	the year 2000," he said. "We must avoid the situation in recent
	years of importing more than 10 mln tonnes of grain."
	    The paper quoted Deng as saying that the State Council has
	decided to raise the price of five grains, including corn and
	rice, unchanged since 1978, but it gave no details.

	LYNG WARNS U.S. TRADE SITUATION IS EXPLOSIVE (RPT)

	trade, grain, rice, carcass, livestock, orange

CONTENT:
	U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng
	said Japanese government officials do not seem to understand
	that protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Could lead to an
	explosive situation and protectionist legislation.
	    Speaking to the National Press Club of Japan, Lyng said
	protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Has increased alarmingly
	during the last six months.
	    "It is a radically changed situation and is very explosive.
	We are on the verge of some very harsh mandatory retaliatory
	laws which would have very serious consequences for other
	countries, especially Japan," Lyng told reporters.
	    Lyng's comments about protectionist trade legislation
	appeared to be a reference to the so-called Gephardt provision,
	requiring retaliation against countries which have trade
	surpluses with the U.S., Trade analysts said.
	    U.S. House majority leader Thomas Foley, a Washington
	Democrat, yesterday predicted during a visit here that the
	Gephardt provision will be approved by the House when trade
	legislation is taken up later this month.
	    Senior Japanese officials do not seem to perceive the
	volatility of the situation in the U.S., Where Congress is
	increasingly unpredictable, he said.
	    "The purpose of this trip is to emphasise the fact that
	patience is beginning to be very much frayed in Washington. I
	cannot emphasise that enough," Lyng said.
	    In talks with Japanese Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato
	yesterday, Lyng and Trade representative Clayton Yeutter asked
	Japan to begin negotiations on its rice policy and end import
	quotas on beef and citrus.
	    Lyng said he was disappointed Kato rejected the U.S.
	Request but hoped it would not lead to a protectionist response
	in Congress, where legislation on rice retaliation has been
	introduced in both the House and Senate.
	    Lyng said the U.S. Is dependent on Japan as a market for
	exports because Japan has been the largest buyer of U.S. Farm
	products since 1964, especially grains.
	    He said the U.S. Understands Japan, with a limited land
	area, is concerned about maintaining some level of
	self-sufficiency in food for national security reasons.
	    But he argued the freeing of farm product imports would not
	necessarily weaken Japanese agriculture.
	    Lyng pledged the U.S. Will never again embargo shipments of
	farm products as it did in 1973.

	GHANA LIFTS RICE/MAIZE IMPORT BAN DUE TO DROUGHT
TOPICS:
	grain, corn, rice
PLACES:

CONTENT:
	Ghana has lifted a ban on rice and maize
	imports due to crop problems caused by unusually dry weather,
	the official Ghana News Agency (GNA) reported today.
	    Secretary for Finance and Economic Planning Kwesi Botchwey
	made the announcement last night while accepting 7,891 tonnes
	of rice worth about four mln dlrs under a Japanese food aid
	programme.
	    The lifting of the ban, imposed earlier this year, follows
	government concern over "lower than average rainfall in southern
	Ghana and its implications for the major harvest."
	    Botchwey said rain has been lacking in major cereal growing
	areas throughout the south this year. The Ministry of
	Agriculture has predicted a fall of at least 25 pct in all
	major staple crops including maize, rice and cassava.
	    GNA quoted Botchwey as saying that while the consequences
	of current reduced rainfall will be nowhere near the drought
	experiences of 1982/83 the government has taken steps to
	alleviate anticipated food production shortfalls.
	    The failure of seasonal rains has already seriously
	affected drinking water supplies, farming and fishing in parts
	of the Central and Volta regions of Ghana where rivers have
	dried up.
