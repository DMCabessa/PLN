CONTENT:
	The Bank of England said it had invited
	the discount houses to make an early round of bill offers to
	help offset a large liquidity shortage in the money market.
	    It estimated the shortage at around 1.55 billion stg, one
	adverse factor being the unwinding of a sale and repurchase
	agreement, with the market having to buy back bills worth 542
	mln stg from the Bank.
	    Bills maturing in official hands and the treasury bill
	take-up would drain 957 mln stg wile exchequer transactions and
	a note circulation rise would take out 15 mln and 25 mln
	respectively. Above target bankers' balances would add 10 mln.

	COMMERCIAL UNION GETS MEDIUM-TERM NOTE PROGRAM
TOPICS:
	
PLACES:

CONTENT:
	Commercial Union Assurance <CUAC.L>, a
	composite insurance company in the U.K., Said it is arranging a
	financing facility totalling 750 mln European Currency Units
	(ECUs) which will now include a medium term note program.
	    Barry Cameron-Smail, Commercial Union's treasurer, said the
	new financing will not increase its debt outstanding but rather
	act as an umbrella for all its financing needs.
	     Commercial Union has had a Euro-commercial paper program
	since the autumn of 1985 and a guilder commercial paper program
	since January 1986.
	    Cameron-Smail said Commercial Union decided on having the
	financing denominated in ECUs because it is more stable than
	most major currencies, and because it would give greater
	flexibility in its financings as it expands operations abroad.
	    Although banks are anxious to develop a market for medium
	term notes, only a few companies such as Electrolux AB and
	Pepsico Inc have gone so far as to arrange one. Commercial
	Union is the first U.K. Company to set up such a program.
	    Cameron-Smail said the company seeks to help the
	development of such a market as it would provide a new funding
	base for its medium term assets.
	     Cameron-Smail said that aside from traditional lines of
	business, Commercial Union would like to move into other areas
	where it may not be able to fund the assets itself. "This (the
	medium term note program) will be the platform for developing
	those assets," he said.
	    He said Commercial Union will work closely with dealers for
	the note program to find the right pricing level to satisfy
	investor demands. The program will be investor driven, he
	noted, adding that the company wants the notes placed with end
	investors and not traded in the secondary market.
	    Commercial Union will be able to issue medium term notes in
	U.S. Dollars or sterling, with the dollar notes listed in
	Luxembourg, while the sterling notes will be listed in London.
	    Bankers expect that the maturities will be concentrated in
	the one to five year area.
	    The dealers for the program are Barclays de Zoete Wedd,
	Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd, Goldman Sachs International,
	Swiss Bank Corporation International Ltd and S.G. Warburg and
	Co Ltd.
