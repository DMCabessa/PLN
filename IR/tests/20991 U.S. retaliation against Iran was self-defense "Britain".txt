	BRITAIN BACKS U.S. STRIKE ON IRAN OIL PLATFORM

CONTENT:
	British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey
	Howe backed the United States' attack on an Iranian oil
	platform on Monday and said it should not worsen the Gulf
	crisis.
	    "The United States is fully entitled to take military action
	in exercise of rights of self-defense, in the face of the
	imminent threat of further attacks," Howe said in a statement
	issued in London.
	    The United States said its forces destroyed the platform on
	Monday in retaliation for an Iranian missile attack on a U.S.-
	flagged Kuwaiti ship last Friday.
	    Referring to that attack, Howe added, "I trust the Iranians
	will fully understand that continued attacks of this kind will
	only enhance justification for firm action in self-defense."
	    At a press conferenced in Luxembourg during a meeting of
	European Community (EC) ministers, Howe was asked about
	statements from a senior Iranian official who said America was
	now involved in a full-scale war.
	    "It would be profoundly undesirable and quite unjustified
	for Iran to react in that way," he said.

	TENSE TRADE TIES TO DOMINATE EC TALKS
TOPICS:

CONTENT:
	Tense trade relations with the U.S.
	And Japan and concern about the foreign impact of a proposed
	European Community (EC) tax on edible oils and fats are
	expected to dominate talks by EC foreign ministers here
	tomorrow.
	    EC diplomats said Britain demanded the early debate on the
	EC Executive Commission's proposal to impose a hefty tax on
	domestic and imported oils and fats in an attempt to head off a
	proposal it sees as extremely damaging to EC foreign relations.
	    The proposal was the most controversial part of a reform
	package, due to be discussed by EC farm ministers later this
	month, of the EC's Common Agricultural Policy -- widely seen as
	the root cause of the EC's persistent financial problems and of
	tensions with major trading partners.
	    The proposal is described by its promoters as a
	stabilisation program which would penalise a new sector going
	into massive overproduction and complement proposals to cut
	cereals and dairy production, rather than a straight forward
	tax.
	    They say it would not only curb the growth of oils and fats
	production and prevent imports from filling any vaccum left by
	a fall in EC output, but would also save the EC some two
	billion European Currency Units, over two billion dlrs, in farm
	costs.
	    It has provoked strong protests from domestic producers as
	well as foreign exporters, led by the United States.
	    The diplomats said the protests had been received from most
	corners of the developing and developed world, ranging from
	Senegal, Malaysia and Indonesia, to Brazil, Argentina, Canada,
	Iceland and Norway.
	    The proposal had little chance of approval by EC
	governments, with West Germany as strongly opposed to it as
	Britain, and Denmark, the Netherlands and Portugal also
	unconvinced of its political or economic wisdom.
	    Even Mediterranean countries such as Italy, France and
	Greece, which backed similar proposals in the past, did not
	seem as enthusiastic now because olive oil had been added to
	the list of products affected.
	    But the diplomats said a protectionist lobby in the U.S.
	And elsewhere was using the proposal as an excuse to promote
	anti-EC action, and the foreign ministers' debate should
	demonstrate the strength of feeling against the proposal within
	the EC and deprive its oponents of this argument.
	    The ministers were also due to discuss proposals in the
	U.S. Congress for a range of protecionist legislation such as a
	bill that would curb EC textile exports.
	    The diplomats said the ministers were expected to strongly
	back a Commission warning to Washington that such a bill, if
	enacted, would provoke swift EC retaliation.

CONTENT:
	Toshiba Corp <TSBA.T>, the Japanese
	electronics group which plans to enter Britain's liberalised
	telecommunications equipment market, risks becoming the first
	casualty in the current war of words over trade between Japan
	and the U.K., Government and industry sources said.
	    U.K. Authorities have lost patience with Japanese trading
	practices and said they are seeking ways to retaliate without
	unleashing a damaging trade war. "Toshiba's timing seems most
	unfortunate for the company, as it comes exactly when we are
	looking for someone to punch," one official told Reuters.
	    Earlier, <Toshiba Information Systems (U.K.) Ltd> said it
	wanted to enter the British business facsimile and key
	telephone market. A facsimile machine sends printed data over
	telephone lines, while a key telephone system is used for
	switching calls within a business, industry sources said.
	    The move by Toshiba comes in the middle of a dispute over
	Japan's refusal to open up its telecommunications market to
	foreign companies. "Toshiba's timing is most extraordinary," one
	official at the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) said.
	    Tomorrow, the U.K. Government will consider what legal
	action it can possible take to press for Japanese reform.
	    Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has given notice that the
	U.K. Would fight the Japanese government's attempt to prevent
	Cable and Wireless Plc <CAWL.L> from taking a significant
	position in a new Japanese international telecommunications
	venture. "We regard this as a test case," she told Parliament.
	    But while the U.K. Is keen to see some movement on the
	issue by Japan, it is also worried that recent anti-Japanese
	rhetoric may cause developments to get out of hand, officials
	said.
	    Japanese officials in Tokyo today reiterated that Japan had
	no plans to bow to U.K. And U.S. Pressure to give foreign
	telecommunications firms a bigger role there.
	    The government, for which competition and the deregulation
	of markets are major political themes, is unlikely to make
	final decisions tomorrow on how to act against Japan, officials
	said.
	    Detailed consideration of the issue has been shelved during
	Thatcher's official visit to the Soviet Union, which ends
	today.
	    "We are waiting for the Prime Minister to decide what to do.
	The DTI will pass the ball to her as soon as she returns
	tonight," a DTI official said.
	    He said Toshiba's application would be considered by the
	Office of Telecommunications (OFTEL). An OFTEL spokeswoman said
	"a decision on this application will take weeks, maybe months."
	    Asked whether Toshiba's bid would fall victim to British
	retaliation, the OFTEL spokeswoman said: "Who knows what's going
	to happen given the current situation!"
	    A Toshiba executive, who asked not to be named, told
	Reuters: "We do not anticipate any special problems."
	    Some analysts queried by Reuters questioned the basis of
	Britain's strong stand on the Cable and Wireless bid. One said
	that the company's proposal was equivalent to a Japanese
	company wanting to take a stake in Mercury International, the
	subsidiary of Cable and Wireless that is the only real
	competitor of British Telecommunications Plc <BTY.L>.
	    British Corporate Affairs minister Michael Howard leaves
	for Japan on Saturday.
	    The minister will seek a clear timetable from Japan for
	easier access for British institutions to Japanese financial
	markets, reciprocating the easy access Japanese securities
	houses and banks have to the City of London.
	    Britain has threatened to use its new Financial Services
	Act to revoke or deny licences to Japanese brokerage houses if
	it does not get satisfaction.
	    But British authorities would be far from happy if forced
	to use that weapon, government sources said.
	    Sir Nicholas Goodison, Chairman of the London Stock
	Exchange, said in New York yesterday that sanctions against
	Japanese financial institutions operating in the U.K. Would set
	back London's ambition to become a leading centre for corporate
	financing and securities trading.
	    Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson also warned
	yesterday of the negative effects that a trade war could have
	on the British economy. Such a development could hit U.K.
	Exports and sharply alter the outlook for the next general
	election in which economic recovery will be one of the
	government's main themes, political analysts said.

	JAPANESE BANKS EXPAND HONG KONG PRESENCE
TOPICS:
	
PLACES:
	japan, hong-kong, uk
CONTENT:
	At a time when Britain is threatening
	to revoke the license of Japanese banks in retaliation for
	restrictive trade practices, Hong Kong is rolling out the
	welcome mat to Japan.
	    The British colony last week issued a banking licence to
	the Bank of Fukuoka Ltd, making it the 24th Japanese bank here.
	    Japan has the largest banking contingent in Hong Kong,
	followed by the U.S. With 22 banks. Eleven Japanese banks have
	representative offices here and Japanese institutions operate
	34 deposit-taking companies (DTCs).
	    Assistant banking commissioner K.K Wong told Reuters: "There
	are no special favours towards the Japanese...But because of
	Japan's strong economy and currency, they easily meet our
	requirement on assets (14 billion U.S. Dlrs)."
	    The Japanese control the largest share of assets of the
	financial institutions here but incorporated elsewhere, with
	980.5 billion H.K. Dlrs at end-1986, or 57.5 pct of the total.
	    "Hong Kong authorities welcome Japanese banks," said Haruo
	Kimura, assistant general manager of the Bank of Tokyo. "But the
	U.S. And Britain are unhappy with the slow liberalisation of
	the Tokyo financial market."
	    Japanese bankers said Hong Kong offers good business
	opportunities, especially in China trade, to Japanese banks who
	are following their clients' international expansion.
	    "As their clients become more international, they have to
	keep up and follow them," said Yutaka Toda, Dai-Ichi Kangyo
	Bank's general manager here.
	    "We can have access to local traders and regional
	corporations," said Bank of Tokyo's Kimura. "We can also pick up
	business with China."
	    Bankers said more Japanese banks are on the way. An influx
	of Japanese banks began in the late 1970s when the government
	lifted a moratorium on new licences. But newcomers are allowed
	one branch each and only the Bank of Tokyo, Sanwa Bank and
	Sumitomo Bank have more than one branch.
	    Because of this limitation, Japanese banks have mostly
	concentrated on wholesale business.
	    "It is very difficult to compete with those giants such as
	the Hongkong Bank and the Bank of China," said Kimura of the
	Bank of Tokyo.
	    Bank of Tokyo has the largest Japanese bank network here
	with seven branches, while Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp
	and the Bank of China groups each have hundreds of branches.
	    To broaden their client and deposit base, some Japanese
	banks have taken equity in local banks. The latest such move
	was Dai-Ichi Kangyo's increase of its stake in Chekiang First
	Bank last year to 95 pct from 33 pct.
	    Tokai Bank, Fuji Bank and Mitsubishi Bank also have
	interests in small local banks.
	    But Mitsubishi, not content with its single-branch licence
	and a 25 pct stake in the small Liu Chong Hing Bank, bought
	Mercantile Bank Ltd's multi-branch licence early this year.
	    "We will open one more branch in (Hong Kong's district of)
	Kowloon soon, to better serve our clients on the other side of
	the harbour," said Mitsubishi Bank general manager Takeshi
	Tange.
	    Their weakness in the retail market forces Japanese banks
	to rely on the interbank market for funding.
	    Government data show that despite their large share of
	total assets, Japanese banks had only 54.4 billion dlrs in
	deposits at end-1986, or 17.1 pct of deposits of banks in Hong
	Kong incorporated elsewhere.
	    "Most Japanese banks' international lendings in the region
	are booked in Hong Kong," said a Japanese banker who declined to
	be named.
	    He said it is mainly for tax reasons, adding that assets
	such as loans booked in Hong Kong are not subject to Japanese
	tax.
	    Japanese banks are barred by the Tokyo government from
	issuing Eurobonds, but their Hong Kong subsidiaries can tap the
	Euromarket and lend the funds to the parent.
	    Bankers said this role could be undermined by a five pct
	capital adequacy ratio that goes into effect next year,
	requiring many DTC's to increase their capital. Many Japanese
	banks are seeking special treatment for their largely offshore
	operations or a different risk calculation for their assets.
	    "I don't think this will stop them from coming here," said a
	banker. "But it may mean they have to conduct some of their
	offshore funding operations elsewhere."

	UK MAY REVOKE JAPANESE FINANCIAL LICENSES
TOPICS:

PLACES:

CONTENT:
	The British government may revoke the
	licences of selected Japanese banks and securities companies
	operating in London's financial City when they come up for
	renewal next summer if progress is not made towards opening up
	Japan's markets to foreign competition, government sources
	said.
	    "We can't say "yes, we are going to do it (revoke licences)"
	but this is definitely being considered," an official said.
	    His comments came after the government was formally urged
	today by a cross-section of influential MPs to take joint
	retaliatory action with the United States against Japan.
	    Britain has grown increasingly impatient with Japanese
	trade practices. "There's a sense of urgency here now, but the
	emphasis is on securing - not undermining - our interests in
	Japan," another government official told Reuters.
	    Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said on Thursday that
	Britain would not hesitate to use new powers contained in the
	Financial Services Act 1986 and the Banking Bill to retaliate
	against countries that do not offer reciprocal market access.
	    She clearly had Japan in mind, government sources said.
	    The U.K. Last year showed a trade defict with Japan of 3.7
	billion stg, official figures show.
	    A parliamentary motion, signed by 98 MPs, today urged the
	U.K. Government to "coordinate action with the President of the
	United States, and through the Department of Trade and
	Industry, to suspend all further applications from Japanese
	communications companies for equipment approval by the British
	Approvals Board for Telecommunications, and all further
	applications from Japanese financial institutions for licences"
	until authorities in Japan stopped imposing what the MPs called
	"restrictive conditions" on the bid by (Cable and Wireless PLC)
	(cawl.L) and its U.S. And Japanese partners for a stake in
	Japan's international telecommunications market.
	    The motion for retaliatory steps came from a cross-section
	of MPs, reflecting the strength of feeling inside Parliament.
	Parliamentarians said their action would increase pressure on
	the Conservative government to take firm action.
	    Officials said another option now being considered by the
	U.K. Is to refuse issuing new banking licences to Japanese
	institutions. That could be done under the government's
	proposed Banking Bill now moving through parliament.
	    58 Japanese financial institutions are authorised to deal
	in London, of which 29 are banks. In Tokyo, 14 London-based
	firms are authorised to do financial business, officials said.
	    The new financial services and banking acts offer Britain
	an alternative for retaliation which would be otherwise denied
	under legally-binding international trade agreements.
	    "The Financial Services Act gives (Trade and Industry
	Secretary Paul) Channon power to stop firms from engaging in
	investment, banking and insurance," one official said.
	    "This point has been made to the Japanese at official level
	a number times," the official added.
	    Britain and France are now working together to urge that
	the European Community take collective action against Japan,
	but by working within EC treaties, another official said.
	    British Trade Minister Alan Clark said this week in a radio
	interview that the European Community should build barriers
	against Japanese imports through certification procedures
	similar to those facing European exporters in Japan.
	    "There comes a point where you cannot resist any longer," he
	said, adding "(such barriers) can't be put in place overnight."
	Clark said the issue of reciprocity regarding visible trade
	"strikes at the basis of whether British industry is to have a
	fair access to an extremely large market (Japan) which is
	itself in a very dominant position (in) certain aspects of our
	own domestic market ... It is really a question of fairness."
	    The situation is only likely to worsen following news that
	Japan's trade surplus with the rest of the world rose by more
	than 70 pct in February, year-on-year, to 8.14 billion dlrs
	from 5.7 billion in January, political sources said.
	    But Clark said in his interview that the issues of visible
	trade and access to financial markets should be kept separate.
	    Should Britain decide to act against Japanese financial
	institutions, it would most likely focus on the smaller, rather
	than larger ones, to minimise any risks to its role as a global
	business centre, government sources said. Japan's four largest
	securities houses are members of the London Stock Exchange.
	    In Washington, White House officials said President Reagan
	was ready to impose retaliatory trade action against Japan for
	breaking its semiconductor agreement with the United States.
	    There was no immediate indication when Reagan might act on
	the recommendations of his Economic Policy Council to curb
	Japanese exports to the United States but officials said the
	move could come today or early next week.
	    Trade sources said the actions being weighed by Reagan
	included tariffs on a wide variety of Japanese exports which
	use semiconductors.

	    But most experts agree that a major overhaul of price
	differentials is unlikely, so as to avoid giving the market
	signals of a dent in OPEC's new unity.
	    "All OPEC members can make a good case for changing
	differentials," said one analyst with a major oil company. "But
	at the end of the day, the attitude is going to be "leave well
	alone' and little or nothing is likely to be altered."
	    Iran, Libya and Saudi Arabia are among those who also saw
	sales problems earlier this year, traders say. But diminished
	customer resistance to fixed prices and, in some cases,
	marketing incentives have helped their sales.
	    Some producers can sell uncompetitively priced crudes by
	means of discounts, processing deals or selling them alongside
	better priced grades in a "package."
	    Many OPEC crudes are seen to be reasonably priced, at least
	for some part of the year. But many experts say OPEC should
	change prices quarterly or monthly to match seasonal demand for
	fuel oil-rich heavy crudes and gasoline-rich lighter grades. At
	its last meeting in December, OPEC agreed to reintroduce fixed
	prices from February 1 around an 18 dlr per barrel reference
	point. Official prices had been effectively dropped in 1985
	when members offered discounts to attract customers.
	    OPEC also decided to limit first-half 1987 output to 15.8
	mln bpd and proposed ceilings of 16.6 mln for the third quarter
	and 18.3 mln for the fourth. Analysts expect it will now extend
	or raise slightly the current ceiling for the coming months.
	    Spot market and netback values for some crudes do not
	mirror official prices, but OPEC will probably keep the 18 dlr
	target and at most make minimal changes to differentials,
	analysts say.
	    The 18 dlr figure is based on a basket of six OPEC and one
	non-OPEC crudes. OPEC assigned prices to its other key export
	crudes, with a 2.65 dlr gap between the heaviest and lightest.
	Extra heavy crudes were among those left out.
	    Industry estimates vary on the proportion of OPEC oil
	exports actually sold at official prices. Several experts say
	only one-quarter to one-third of the total in fact sells at
	official prices, with some of the rest included in processing
	or barter deals or sold in the form of refined products.
	    Problems with the new structure appeared earlier this year,
	when some producers' output fell due to customer reluctance to
	pay the new prices.
	   Nigeria especially found its gasoline-rich Bonny Light crude
	-- now OPEC's highest priced grade at 18.92 dlrs a barrel --
	was uncompetitive on the spot market against Britain's Brent.
	    In February and March, Nigeria's production shrank below
	its 1.238 mln bpd OPEC quota. Spot prices have since revived,
	due partly to seasonal demand for gasoline, and its output has
	risen.
	    Some experts feel Bonny Light is still overvalued and say
	its price should be cut by between 50 cts to one dlr a barrel.
	    But Mehdi Varzi, chief oil analyst with London's Kleinwort
	Grieveson Securities, doubts Nigeria will actively push the
	differentials question in Vienna.
	    "It would not look good for OPEC unity if Nigeria, which
	holds the presidency, raised the issue," he said.

	OPPOSITION SAYS UK GOV'T GAVE ARMS TO CONTRAS

	A leading member of Britain's opposition
	Labour Party said there was strong evidence Prime Minister
	Margaret Thatcher approved the sale of anti- aircraft missiles
	to Nicaraguan Contra rebels during talks last year with U.S.
	Officials involved in the Iran arms scandal.
	    Labour foreign affairs spokesman George Foulkes told
	parliament the U.S. Tower Commission report on the sale of arms
	to Iran showed Colonel Oliver North had tried to obtain 20
	Blowpipe missiles and 10 launchers through a South American
	country from a Belfast-based company, Short Brothers, which
	manufactures the missiles.
	    Short Brothers is owned by the British Government.
	    Junior Foreign Officer Minister Timothy Eggar dismissed the
	claims as "wild and fanciful allegations" with no foundation.
	    Foulkes said North testified he was seeking the help of "a
	head of an allied government" in obtaining the Blowpipes and
	suggested the supply of missiles was discussed during two
	meetings which he said took place between North, the then head
	of the CIA William Casey and Thatcher in 1986.
	    "We need to know what happened at those meetings between Mr
	Casey, Colonel North and the Prime Minister last year. What
	were they talking about if it were not the supply of Blowpipe
	missiles to the Contra terrorists?" Foulkes said.

	BRITAIN, JAPAN CLASH OVER STOCK MARKET ACCESS
TOPICS:
	
PLACES:
	uk, japan
CONTENT:
	Britain and Japan clashed today over U.K.
	Demands for greater access to the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) as
	trade tensions between the two countries mounted.
	    British consumer affairs minister Michael Howard told
	reporters he was dissatisfied with the exchange's response to
	Britain's non-negotiable timetable for increased British
	membership and warned of possible reprisals in the future.
	    He described his meeting with Tokyo stock exchange (TSE)
	head Michio Takeuchi, in which he demanded greater exchange
	access, as "very frank indeed."
	    In a separate press conference, TSE President Michio
	Takeuchi said the exchange has done its utmost to liberalise
	its membership and called on Britain to make some concessions.
	    According to Takeuchi, Howard wants three British firms to
	be named members of the Tokyo stock exchange by the end of this
	year. Neither Takeuchi nor Howard would name the companies.
	    "Next May is the earliest possible date for opening our
	membership and I want the British government to understand
	this," Takeuchi said.
	    Membership cannot be increased before space on the trading
	floor is expanded in May 1988, he said.
	     Howard told reporters that was not good enough and said
	that Britain would use its powers to ban Japanese financial
	institutions from London if it was not satisfied with Tokyo.
	    Japan has until the next meeting of senior officials from
	the two countries in May or June to come up with a postive
	response to the British timetable or face retaliation, he said.
	    "The timetable was constructed in a way that made it a very
	reasonable request and I expect it to be met," he said.
	    Asked about the exchange's argument that it has no floor
	space to expand membership, Howard replied, "We find it very
	difficult in our country to understand why the considerable
	ingenuity and resourcefulness of the Japanese (in world
	markets) is unable to overcome problems of that kind."
	    While here, Howard said he also expressed frustration with
	the huge trade imbalance with Japan and with Tokyo's handling
	of demands by Britain's Cable and Wireless for a greater role
	in Japan's telecommunications business.
	    According to Japanese newspaper reports, at least some of
	that message may have penetrated.
	    According to several reports, the Post and
	Telecommunications Ministry is considering a Cable and Wireless
	proposal for a telephone cable between Japan and the U.S.
	    Ministry officials were unavailable for comment.
