	U.S. SEES MORE HARMONY IN TALKS WITH FRANCE
TOPICS:

PLACES:

CONTENT:
	The U.S. Expects more harmonious
	talks than usual during French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac's
	first official visit this week as frequently rancorous disputes
	between the two countries begin to fade.
	    "The Libyan bombing is a thing of the past, the trade war
	didn't happen and we have reached reasonably good cooperation
	on terrorism," one U.S. Official told Reuters.
	    "It looks like a reasonably harmonious visit in prospect,
	more harmonious than usual."
	    Since taking office a year ago, Chirac has been obliged to
	deal with a series of potentially serious disputes with the
	United States.
	    During the U.S. Bombing of alleged terrorist targets in
	Libya last April, France refused to allow British-based U.S.
	Planes to overfly its territory, forcing them to take a
	circuitous route. That angered Washington.
	    The U.S. Officials, who asked not to be identified, said a
	year ago Washington felt the French were not taking strong
	enough action against terrorism. "Now they are. We're pleased
	and they are pleased that we are pleased," one said.
	    More recently, a dispute over U.S. Access to the grain
	markets of Spain and Portugal after they joined the European
	Community  threatened to become a trade war.
	    In retaliation for what Washington saw as deliberate
	Community moves to exclude U.S. Grain, the United States was
	poised to impose swingeing tariffs on European Community food
	imports and a major trade war was averted at the last minute.
	    Last week, the forces of President Hissene Habre of Chad,
	supported, trained and armed by Paris and Washington, scored a
	major success by pushing Libyan troops out of their last bases
	in northern Chad.
	    A French official added: "There is also a common interest in
	getting Japan to cut its trade surplus with the rest of the
	world by opening up its markets."
	    Although relations have improved markedly between the two
	countries, many irritants remain. At the top of the list is the
	Community's common agricultural policy (CAP).
	    To Washington, as one official put it, "CAP is the root of
	all evil" in international food trade because it subsidises
	farmers and sells vast amounts of excess produce at below world
	prices, thereby eating into U.S. Markets.

	<British Caledonian Group>, Britain's
	second largest airline, has announced a 19.3 mln stg pretax
	loss for the financial year ending last October, compared with
	a record pre-tax profit of 21.7 mln stg in 1985, chairman Sir
	Adam Thomson told reporters.
	    A decline in U.S. Transatlantic traffic following terrorist
	attacks in Europe, the U.S. Bombing of the Libya, the Chernobyl
	disaster and a slump in the oil industry which affected Middle
	East traffic were the main causes of the loss, Thomson said.
	    He said the poor results were caused by "a range of
	exceptional circumstances wholly outside our direct control" and
	predicted a return to profitability this year.
	    Last year, the airline was forced to axe 1,000 jobs, sell
	some of its assets and cut the number of its flights across the
	Atlantic and to the Middle East following the fall in business
	.

	    Douffiagus said that transatlantic cooperation was already

	U.S.-CANADA TIES SEEN WORSE WITHOUT TRADE PACT
TOPICS:

CONTENT:
	U.S.-Canadian ties could worsen if
	the two nations are unable to reach a free trade pact,
	according to a study published by two nonpartisan public policy
	research groups.
	    The Cato Institute of Washington and the Fraser Institute
	of Vancouver said removing the remaining tariffs on cross
	border trade would benefit both countries.
	    But Cato chairman William Niskanen added "the two nations'
	generally harmonious trade relations are probably not
	sustainable without a new agreement."
	    The United States and Canada, whose cross-border trade
	totaled about 125 billion dlrs last year, have been holding
	talks since last June on a pact to end the few trade barriers
	remaining between their two countries.
	    The U.S. put a deadline on the talks of October 1, but both
	sides have said an agreement is likely despite tough bargaining
	remained.
	    Niskanen said if no pact is reached, bilateral trade ties
	could deteriorate because of Congressional pressure on
	President Reagan to implement trade laws more aggressively, and
	this could hit some Canadian trade practices.
	    He noted Canada is seeking foreign investment in its auto
	industry, which could put strains on the considerable bilateral
	free trade in U.S. and Canadian autos and parts.
	    Niskanen also said the Canadian government is vulnerable to
	a resurgence of economic nationalism which could restrict U.S.
	exports to Canada.
	    A free trade pact, backed by President Reagan and Prime
	Minister Brian Mulroney, would open new markets for Canada and
	enable its industries to achieve economies of scale, which
	would also help it widen exports worldwide, he said.
	    It would also increase the gross national products of both
	countries.
	    Niskanen said the goal of a pact should be to end all
	tariffs within 10 years, lower subsidies on exports, set rules
	for trade in services and investments, end curbs on government
	procurement and agree ways to resolve trade disputes.

	AIRLINE ANALYSTS STUDY BRITISH AIRWAYS <BAB>
TOPICS:
	
PLACES:
	usa, uk
CONTENT:
	Since British Airways was sold to the
	public by the British government, airline analysts have begun
	covering the big carrier and giving it good reviews.
	    "Analysts are picking up British Airways because it's a
	major airline, and because they have fewer companies to work
	with after all the mergers," said Merrill Lynch analyst Edmund
	Greenslet. "Two years ago there were enough U.S. carriers, but
	now more analysts are adding the international airlines."
	    Merrill Lynch, for instance, will be covering it from its
	international offices, he said.
	    British Airways was sold to the public by the Conservative
	government in February.
	    It has a fleet of 167 jetliners, making it the largest in
	Europe. A relatively small portion of revenue and traffic comes
	from intra-U.K. operations, and its predominantly long-haul
	route network spans the globe.
	    Julius Maldutis at Salomon Brothers said he likes British
	Airways because it can quickly redeploy jets to strong markets
	or away from weak ones, as it did last year in response to the
	severe downturn in North Atlantic traffic after the Chernobyl
	nuclear disaster and terrorist actions.
	    "Because of its diverse network, it has the ability to
	hedge or mitigate adverse developments in one particular area,"
	Maldutis said.
	    He said British Airways should outperform the rest of the
	stock market. Salomon was an underwriter for the company's
	public offering in February.
	    About 6.3 mln British Airways' American depositary receipts
	are traded on the NYSE, and 2.8 mln ADRs on the Toronto
	exchange. Each ADR equals 10 ordinary shares.
	    Louis Marckesano at Janney Montgomery Scott said British
	Airways near-term outlook is good. "We're looking for good
	traffic growth and improved revenues," he said.
	    "British Airways should be riding a good wave," he said.
	"Its fiscal year began April one, so when you think of all the
	troubles it experienced in the first half of last year,
	especially in the North Atlantic market, you know all
	camparisons should be nice."
	    At March 31 the carrier had total debt of 279 mln stg for a
	debt-to-equity ratio of 33 pct, which is very good for an
	airline, analysts said.
	    "Its balance sheet is very conservative - perhaps too
	conservative for an airline - but that means it can borrow to
	expand its fleet," Marckesano said.
	    British Airways has been a leading force of airline
	liberalization in Europe, which is being gradually implemented
	to avoid the problems of U.S. airline deregulation, which
	brought years of unstable fares and losses.
	    Analysts agree a phased-in deregulation will greatly
	benefit British Airways over the long run because it is the
	largest European carrier.
	    Analysts caution that British Airways faces increasing
	competition for travelers to Europe from U.S. carriers as
	airline consolidation here expands route networks.
	    In 1983, for instance, about 69 pct of U.K.-bound
	passengers transferred to European carriers after arriving at
	U.S. gateway airports onboard U.S. carriers.
	    But U.S. carriers are retaining more of their passengers,
	and this year about 30 pct of U.K.-bound travelers are expected
	to switch to a European carrier to complete the trip, according
	to British Airways' chief executive officer, Colin Marshall.
	    "British Airways had a greater shot at picking up traffic
	when it was funneled to New York," said Marckesano "Now,
	traffic is being captured earlier by U.S. carriers as it leaves
	Atlanta, Dallas and other cities," said Marckesano.
	    He also said that British Airways' first-half results might
	mislead an investor into gauging full-year results because its
	fiscal year begins April one.
	    "Profits build in the first half. But if an investor just
	doubles that figure, he'll be making a big mistake," he said.

	GENENTECH <GENE> SETBACK VIEWED AS TEMPORARY
TOPICS:
	
PLACES:
	usa
CONTENT:
	Genentech Inc is suffering only a
	temporary setback following a U.S. agency decision to withhold
	a recommendation on its genetically-produced drug which is used
	to treat heart attacks in progress, industry sources and
	analysts said.
	    "When TPA (the drug) first came on the scene, the projected
	time scale for approval was 1990," said Sam Milstein, a
	scientist and industry consultant.
	    "So even with the new delay that has arisen, in all
	likelihood the drug will be approved prior to initial
	projections," he added.
	    Last Friday, an advisory committee at the Food and Drug
	Administration, FDA, withheld a recommendation on Genentech's
	tissue plasminogen activator, a drug called Activase.
	    Athough it supported Genentech's claim that the drug
	dissolves blood clots, the FDA said it wanted data that showed
	the treatment benefits heart-attack victims.
	    "We will be talking to the FDA as soon as possible to ask
	specifically what they are looking for," a Genentech
	spokeswoman said. She said the company had data that showed
	improvement in the heart muscle after the drug was administered
	but had not included it in the FDA filing.
	 
	    Industry analysts also said the 12 point drop in the
	company's stock to 37-1/4 was largely expected in light of the
	speculative nature of the biotechnology companies whose
	fortunes often depend on the success of an important drug.
	    "In larger pharmaceutical companies each product does not
	have as much overall significance. But this is very important
	to Genentech," said Robert Riley, a senior consultant at Arthur
	D. Little Inc.
	    Some estimated that Genentech could see as much as 1.5
	billion dlrs from the drug. But with each delay, others can
	enter the market and catch up to Genentech's lead.
	
	    Industry sources pointed out that KabiVitrum, in an
	alliance with Hoechst AG <HFAG.F>, won a recommendation for its
	streptokinase drug on the same day Genentech's application was
	delayed. Streptokinase, an enzyme-based drug, is also used to
	treat heart attack victims.
	    In addition, Milstein said that Beecham Group Plc <BHAM.L>
	has a drug called Eminase which is "the most likely competitor
	to TPA," and from a clinical standpoint, nearly identical.
	Beecham's drug has been approved for use in Germany and is
	awaiting approval in the U.K., he added.
	     Streptokinase was difficult to administer to heart attack
	victims because it would dissolve before it reached the heart.
	Another method, which involved pumping the drug directly into
	the heart through a tube, proved difficult when a heart attack
	was in progress. TPA was seen as a savior since it was easier
	to administer and worked quickly.
	    But new developments have made streptokinase more effective
	and easier to administer, becoming a potential threat to
	Genentech's grasp on the TPA market. And if that wasn't enough,
	about 30 other biotech companies are quickly developing TPA in
	Genentech's path.
	 
	    "Genentech's advantage is being first in the market," said
	industry consultant Scott King, formerly an analyst with
	Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. "They'll be the first
	approved but then they'll face competition after one or two
	years."
	    The company may also face patent pressures for its drug. It
	is currently about to go to court with Beecham Group in the
	U.K. in a patent dispute. And while its patent is pending in
	the U.S., many analysts expect the company to face some suits
	as soon as the patent is issued, a potentially more harmful
	situation than any temporary setback in the FDA.

	EC COMMISSION DEFENDS FARM PROGRAM

CONTENT:
	The European Community's (EC)
	executive Commission defended attacks on major elements of its
	ambitious program to rid the EC of its controversial farm
	surpluses, after strong attacks from northern states.
	    Britain and West Germany, backed by the Netherlands and
	Denmark, opposed a proposed tax on edible oils and fats which
	has already sparked strong protest from exporters to the EC led
	by the U.S. and from EC consumer groups, diplomats said.
	    But EC Agriculture Commissioner Frans Andriessen told
	journalists he had warned ministers that failure to agree the
	tax, proposed last month as part of the Commission's annual
	farm price package, would leave a large hole in the group's
	budget.
	    He added that he hoped states had not yet made their mind
	up for good. "I hope the debate is still open, if not there will
	be a formidable hole in the budget," he said.
	    The shortfall could reach two billion dollars in 1988 and
	would be only slightly less this year, he said.
	    Foreign ministers were taking a first look at the tax ahead
	of farm ministers in a move described by diplomats as
	unprecedented and welcomed by Andriessen as a sign ministers
	recognised the importance of reforming the EC's farm policy.
	    The proposed tax is designed to provide the EC with extra
	cash to finance community oilseed crops at their current levels
	and to brake a dramatic decrease in olive oil consumption by
	making it more competitive with other oils.
	    Andriessen noted the EC has over two mln olive oil
	producers, mostly small farmers, who could be helped by the
	tax.
	    "What we are suggesting is reasonable, it should be better
	understood not just outside the community but at home," he said.
	    Britain, normally a keen advocate of radical changes in the
	EC's costly farm subsidies system, warned the proposal to
	impose the tax on both domestic and imported oils and fats
	could seriously damage the EC's trade relations with other
	countries.
	    Britain also warned that the tax could hit developing
	countries already receiving aid from the EC, they said.
	    The Commission also defended proposals to dismantle
	Monetary Compensatory Amounts (MCA) -- a system of cross border
	subsidies and taxes to level out foreign exchange fluctuations
	for farm exports -- against harsh West German criticism.
	    In a letter this weekend from Chancellor Helmut Kohl to EC
	executive Commission President, Jacques Delors, Kohl made clear
	such a dismantling would mainly hit West German farmers.
	    Diplomats said West Germany again repeated its criticism at
	the talks here but Andriessen told journalists that Germany had
	been alone in its opposition. The question was a key aspect of
	the Commission's farm price proposals, he added.
	   Ministers also agreed a 3.5 billion dlrs scheme to rid the
	EC of its butter mountain, despite Spanish and Portuguese
	opposition.
	    The scheme will pay for the disposal of one mln tonnes of
	unwanted butter, by selling it at knock-down prices, turning it
	into animal feed or exporting it at subsidised prices.
	    National capitals are due to be reimbursed later out of
	savings from another plan to curb milk production.
	    Diplomats said Spain and Portugal have been angered by the
	scheme, which they feel forces them to pay for massive
	surpluses built up before they joined the community last year,
	but the two countries did not block today's vote.

	Trade estimates of the coming

	state of Bahia are now in the 1.5 mln to 2.0 mln 60-kilo bag
	range against 2.0 mln to 2.5 mln two weeks ago.
	    Traders in the state capital Salvador told Reuters the
	effects of a dry period in the first six weeks of the year had
	been harsher than thought earlier.
	    Although good flowering had followed the onset of rains in
	mid-February subsequent pod setting was dissappointing.
	    Last year's temporao, also hit by a dry spell, was 2.77 mln
	bags. In 1984 severe drought cut the crop to 1.79 mln bags.
	    The traders said another factor leading to lower crop
	predictions is that many farmers are not caring properly for
	plantations because of low returns on their investment.
	    Manpower, fertiliser and other costs have been cut back as
	farmers feel the pinch of the rise in interest rates over the
	past six months coupled with low bean prices.
	    If such economies continue into the winter months both the
	temporao and the developing October/April main crop could face
	serious damage from pod rot attacks on trees which would
	normally be treated against the disease.
	    Recent very wet weather has already caused some isolated
	incidences of pod rot but reports from the growing regions say
	these are not yet significant.
	    The traders said they expect very low deliveries of
	temporao beans in the first three months of the harvest and the
	bulk will not appear until the last month, September.
	    Despite the low loads, trees are said to be in excellent
	condition and recent flowering and pod setting - which will
	lead to late temporao/early main crop beans - has been good.

	one." He added, "It is crucial that the United States and the
	European Community remain friends."
	    Jopling, who is a member of the EC agriculture committee,
	was in Indiana to visit several farms prior to talks with U.S.
	officials in Washington later this week.
	    Jopling also criticized a recent proposal still under
	consideration by the EC for a tax on vegetable and fish oils.
	    He said his government would oppose such a move because "We
	do not think it is correct that a shortage of funds to support
	(EC) farmers should be alleviated by raising money at the
	consumer's expense."

TITLE:
	SAUDI TO REMAIN AS KEY LPG SUPPLIER TO JAPAN
TOPICS:
	propane, ship
PLACES:
	iraq, iran, japan, saudi-arabia
CONTENT:
	Saudi Arabia is likely to remain the key
	supplier of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to Japan for at least
	the next five years, oil industry sources said.
	    Japan, while diversifying its supply sources of propane and
	butane for stable supplies, will continue to bank on Saudi
	Arabian LPG, the sources said.
	    They said Saudi's supply capabilities of LPG, an associate
	of crude oil, is guaranteed by its crude output capacity. "Saudi
	is a reliable supplier in that sense," said one trader.
	    Japan imports about 50 pct of its LPG from Saudi Arabia.
	    No single nation could substitute for Saudi Arabia as an
	LPG supply source to Japan, the sources said.
	    "Saudi Arabia has committed itself to Japanese LPG buyers,
	which has quelled fears that LPG supplies from the Mideast Gulf
	could easily be disrupted in the wake of heightened hostilities
	in that area," said another trader.
	    Saudi Arabia cut LPG shipments to Japan and elsewhere by 20
	pct in September after a fire put a major gas plant at
	Al-Juaimah out of operation. October shipments were back to
	contractual volumes as Saudi was able to boost exports from
	other ports.
	    Attacks on Gulf shipping by Iran and Iraq centered on crude
	rather than products carriers, which has lulled fears of LPG
	supply disruptions, traders said.
	    They said an Iranian blockade of the Strait of Hormuz was
	unlikely because it would block Iran's oil shipments.
	    Industry sources said Japan's LPG imports will not greatly
	rise or fall as its domestic demand growth is estimated at a
	moderate 2.1 pct a year from 1986 through 1991.
	    Japanese term buyers of Saudi LPG are expected to lift
	slightly lower volumes from January 1987, when imports from
	Indonesia are slated to increase, the sources said.
	    The customers are unlikely to slash Saudi term purchases in
	large scale when Japan increases annual imports of Indonesian
	LPG to 1.95 mln tonnes in early 1989 from 319,000 tonnes in the
	year ended March 1987, the sources said.
	    But when demand is sluggish in summer, they will phase down
	term purchases of Saudi LPG and secure lower-priced cargoes on
	the spot market, they said.
	    Japan imports some 12 mln tonnes of LPG a year, of which
	5.3 mln tonnes are supplied by Saudi Arabia, 3.3 mln under term
	contracts and two mln through spot purchases. Some 80 pct of
	Japan's LPG imports are from the Middle East.
	    Saudi Arabia's state owned oil company Petromin has made
	some concessions on term prices to Japanese customers in the
	recent round of contract renewal talks, and it is likely the
	Japanese will accept the offer, the sources said.
	    The Japanese term customers, however, have so far been
	unsuccessful in establishing a transparent price formula to
	replace the existing unilateral monthly price notice.
	    Japanese buyers pay Saudi Arabia a price notified by
	Petromin each month. Most recently the FOB price was set at 87
	pct of the 17.52 dlrs per barrel government selling price (GSP)
	of Arabian Light.
	    Buyers reserve the right to phase down or out liftings
	should the monthly price be set at over 95 pct of Arabian
	Light's GSP.
	    Petromin has offered to lower this rate to 90 pct from the
	95 pct for contracts with Japanese customers from next January,
	the trade sources said.
	    Petromin also suggested that a seller's option of supplying
	up to 20 pct more than the contractural volume be subject to
	seller-buyer agreement.
	    Under the present contract, Petromin can automatically cut
	supplies up to 10 pct of the contractual volume.
	    "If you want to import LPG from Saudi Arabia on a profitable
	basis, you have to set the price factor at 80 to 85 pct," said
	an official at a major importer. "Freight costs are higher for
	cargoes coming from the Gulf than Southeast Asia due to a
	longer haul and war risk insurance payments."
	    Japanese customers will visit Saudi Arabia this month to
	finalise their separate contract talks, now focusing on
	contractual period and volume, which could be very similar to
	current levels, the sources said. "When we talk business, we
	would seek profitability and sometimes forget vulnerability of
	high dependence on a single supplier," said one.
