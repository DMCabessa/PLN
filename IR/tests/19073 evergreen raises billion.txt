	Liner shipping specialist <Evergreen
	Marine Corp>, Taiwan's largest private company, has applied to
	the Security and Exchange Commission to go public next month, a
	company spokeswoman told Reuters.
	    She said Evergreen had doubled its capital to eight billion
	Taiwan dlrs since last August.
	    "The capital increase will boost our operations," she said.
	    She said Evergreen will use the funds raised from the stock
	market to buy new ships and step up its global services.
	    The spokeswoman said the company posted an after-tax profit
	of more than one billion dlrs last year on total revenues of
	20.46 billion, compared to an after-tax profit of 1.18 billion
	on revenues of 17.99 billion in 1985.
	    Evergreen has placed newbuilding orders for three 3,428-teu
	(twenty-foot equivalent unit) fully cellular container ships
	with the state-owned <China Shipbuilding Corp> for delivery in
	late 1988.
	    Evergreen has a fleet of 66 container vessels, totalling
	more than two mln dwt, the spokeswoman said.

	UAW SAYS MAJOR WORK STOPPAGE POSSIBLE AT GM, FORD
TOPICS:
	
PLACES:
	usa
CONTENT:
	Leaders of the nation's unionized
	automobile workers have signaled their intent for a major work
	stoppage later this year if General Motors Corp. <GM> and Ford
	Motor Co. <F>  fail to satisfy demands for job security, pay
	raises and protection against shifting U.S. production to
	foreign sources.
	    United Automobile Workers (UAW) president Owen Bieber was
	loudly cheered by some 3,000 local delegates at a special
	bargaining strategy convention yesterday when he declared the
	1.1 mln-member union is ready to go to "war" against the major
	auto makers in support of its goals.
	    "It takes two to make peace, but only one to make war ...
	and if it's war, the UAW will be ready for it. War against the
	insecurity of layoff," the UAW chief said.
	    The militant tone as the four-day convention opened
	underscored the probability for bitter confrontation during the
	summer's labor negotiations between the UAW and the auto
	companies over new contracts covering some 500,000 U.S. workers
	at G.M. and Ford.
	    The current pacts expire September 14.
	    GM Vice President and chief labor negotiator Alfred Warren
	recently told Reuters that the 1987 bargaining round would
	likely be the most difficult of the decade because of the
	carmaker's drive to cut costs and shed uncompetitive
	parts-making operations employing thousands of workers.
	    Job security has been the union's main theme for several
	years. A master resolution stating UAW goals notes that the
	union's membership working in the auto industry has fallen by
	200,000 since 1978 to a current level of about 690,000.
	    GM was hit by a six-day selective national strike in 1984
	before signing its current labor agreement, which contains a
	one billion dlr job security fund to protect workers whose jobs
	are threatened by new technology or moves to outside suppliers.
	    At Ford, which has more than 8 billion dlrs in cash
	reserves and out-earned larger GM last year for the first time
	since 1924, executives said they would oppose the UAW's demand
	for a return to guaranteed percentage annual pay increases that
	were dropped in the last recession.
	    Ford has not been hit by a national strike since 1976,
	which has prompted some union analysts to suggest it is now
	Ford's "turn," to be the UAW strike target.
	    Bieber yesterday described the UAW's situation in 1987 as
	"crucial" in view of the growing penetration of the U.S. market
	by imported cars and trucks as well as moves by the Detroit
	automakers to use foreign and other non-union sources to secure
	cheaper vehicles and auto parts.
	    He said the union will stress job security, annual general
	pay raises, improved profit-sharing and limits on companies'
	ability to transfer work.

	SPAIN RAISES CALL MONEY RATES ON HIGHER DEMAND
TOPICS:

PLACES:

CONTENT:
	The Bank of Spain raised overnight call
	money rates by 1/4 to 14 pct on demand for 746 billion pesetas
	in today's auction, which a bank spokesman termed "heavy."
	    Rates stood at 12.1 pct at the start of the year and have
	been increased to drain liquidity on rising demands for funds,
	the spokesman said.
	    He said in reply to Reuters inquiries that rates could rise
	further if money supply growth rose above this year's eight pct
	target for M-4, defined as liquid assets in public hands.
	    Money supply rose at an annualised rate of 16.7 pct last
	month against 8.1 pct in January. Growth was 11.4 pct in 1986.
	    A leading Spanish broker said the central bank was applying
	a more restrictive policy to keep the lid on inflation.
	    The consumer price index rose 8.3 pct last year.
	    "Money supply control is the government's chief weapon
	against inflation," he said. "The problem is higher rates are
	attracting liquidity from abroad."
	    He said this was why the central bank enacted specific
	measures to control the inflow of foreign capital. The Bank of
	Spain earlier this month imposed a 19 pct reserve requirement
	on new convertible peseta funds held by banks to curb
	short-term speculative capital from abroad.

	securities that would be developed by Dart and Supermarkets.

TOPICS:

PLACES:

CONTENT:
	The Bank of Spain said it raised the
	reserve requirement for banks and savings banks to 19 pct of
	deposits from 18 pct to drain excess liquidity which threatened
	money supply and inflation targets.
	    In a statement issued late last night, the central bank
	said the measure would take effect from March 13.
	    "In recent weeks, there has been excess liquidity in the
	Spanish economy which, if not controlled, would threaten the
	monetary and inflation targets set by the government," the
	statement said.
	    Banking sources said the measure would drain about 200
	billion pesetas from the system. The maximum reserve
	requirement allowed by law is 20 pct.
	    The move follows a half-point increase yesterday in the
	Bank of Spain's key overnight call money rate, which now stands
	at 13.5 pct. At today's auction, however, the bank left the
	rate unchanged.
	    Spain's principal measure of money supply, the broad-based
	liquid assets in public hands (ALP), grew at annualised rate of
	8.3 pct in January compared with 11.4 pct during the whole of
	1986 and a target of eight pct for 1987.
	    Banking sources said that although the January money supply
	figures were good, compared with annualised rates of 13.9 pct
	in December and 10.2 pct in January 1986, ALP growth appeared
	to have accelerated in February, raising government concern.
	    Regarding inflation, recent figures have suggested that
	prices were under control.
	    Secretary of State for Trade, Miguel Angel Fernandez
	Ordonez, said this week that the annualised inflation rate for
	February, not yet officially announced, fell to 5.5 pct from
	six pct in January, compared with inflation of 8.3 pct during
	1986 and a government target of five pct for this year.

	    Citing what it called serious competitive and public

	jurisdiction in the matter and require the two companies to
	seek its approval for the transaction.
	    In a petition to the department, contained in a filing with
	the Securities and Exchange Commission, Coniston also claims
	Boeing, a major aircraft manufacturer, has obtained control
	over Allegis, parent of United Airlines, by virtue of the May
	12 deal between the two companies.
	    Under the deal, Boeing bought from Allegis 700 mln dlrs of
	convertible notes due May 31, 1992 simultaneously with a 2.1
	billion dlr aircraft order United placed with Boeing.
	    Coniston said the notes give Boeing control over Allegis
	and warned that the relationship between the two companies
	raises antitrust issues and should be scrutinized closely.
	    "The world's largest manufacturer of aircraft should not be
	permitted to acquire control over one of the nation's largest
	airlines without an opportunity for public comment and fact
	finding and scrutiny by the regulatory agency having
	jurisdiction over the air transporation marketplace," Coniston
	said in its petition.
	    Coniston, calling itself the Allegis Investors Group in the
	petition, said the department should force Allegis and Boeing
	to make the required regulatory filings.
	    Coniston is currently seeking control of Allegis by winning
	majority representation on its board of directors.
