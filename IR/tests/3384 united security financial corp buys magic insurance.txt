	Walt Disney Co said it has
	signed a definitive agreement with the French government to
	build and operate Euro Disneyland on 5,000 acres at
	Marne-la-Vallee, a new town 20 miles east of Paris.
	    The company said construction is scheduled to start next
	year and the theme park portion of the development -- which
	will also include a resort and recreation complex -- will take
	about four years to build.  The theme park is expected to
	attract at least 10 mln visitors a year, Disney said.
	    The company said Euro Disneyland will offer a Magic Kingdom
	theme park like those at its Anaheim, Calif., Orlando, Fla.,
	and Tokyo complexes and peripheral resort and recreation
	facilities similar to those at Walt Disney World in Orlando.
	    Disney said it will seek other equity investors in Euro
	Disneyland from France and elsewhere in the world.
	    It said provisions for a second theme park on the property
	are included in the understanding with the French government,
	which is selling Disney the land.  In Orlando, Disney also
	operates EPCOT Center.
	    The company said long-term plans include convention
	facilities, a business park, an office complex and other
	related tourist developments.
	    Disney said the French government will extend the Paris
	Metro subway system to the park and build interchanges and
	raods to provide superhighway access.
	    It said it will receive royalties based on gross revenues
	from admissions, food and merchandise and will receive a fee to
	operate Magic Kingdom and other resort elements under a
	management contract.  Disney said Eruo Disneyland will operate
	year-round.

	ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - EFTA FEARS EC MARKET PLANS
TOPICS:
	
PLACES:
	turkey, switzerland, austria, west-germany, france, norway
CONTENT:
	The European Community wants to eliminate
	all obstacles to free movement of goods, services and people by
	1992, a laudable goal that has sent shivers down the spines of
	its closest trading neighbours.
	    Europe's outsiders -- the six members of the European Free
	Trade Association (EFTA), and other small states -- fear the
	growing power of the 12 EC member countries, a market of 320
	mln people, one and a half times as big as the whole U.S.
	    And as the Community celebrates its 30th anniversary, in
	non-EC countries from Ankara to Oslo, an attitude is emerging
	which says, "If you can't beat them, join them."
	    In June 1985, the Community adopted a plan to create an
	"internal market" without restrictions, which included new goals
	on everything from tourism to the rules of bank accounting.
	    The plan is so extensive that even the EFTA countries --
	Switzerland, Austria, Sweden, Norway, Finland and Iceland --
	with decades of close trade ties, find it hard to adopt a joint
	position.
	    Last month Turkey formally requested EC membership,
	receiving a polite reply from Brussels that the time was not
	ripe.
	    In Austria, where its 1955 charter of neutrality forbids
	joining political alliances, the government is looking for ways
	to become a "de facto" EC member.
	    And in Norway, where membership was rejected in a 1972
	referendum, government officials are wondering whether the
	political climate has changed.
	    But nowhere has the debate been more existential than in
	Switzerland, which has resisted all alliances for 700 years.
	    The Swiss are a microcosm of Europe, living geographically
	in the very heart of Europe and speaking the languages of the
	three big economies -- Germany, France and Italy.
	    Swiss neutrality, which has kept the country out of the
	United Nations and the International Monetary Fund, would seem
	to preclude membership in the Community, given the EC's loose
	link with the Western defence alliance NATO.
	    But an opinion poll late last year, held in the
	French-speaking part of the country, showed a majority favoured
	joining the Community.
	    Since then, government officials have stressed that, while
	membership was impossible, Switzerland should do everything
	possible not to be locked out when the trade barriers inside
	the EC come down.
	    State secretary for foreign trade Franz Blankart, said it
	is inconceivable the whole Swiss nation -- including the more
	conservative German-speaking majority -- would vote for
	membership.
	    But Switzerland must be more than just a "satellite," he
	said, now that the enlarged Community is extending itself into
	areas omitted by the founding Treaty of Rome.
	    These areas, including pharmaceutical research and
	technological development, are the key to the economic future
	of Switzerland and the Community alike, he adds.
	    "We cannot permit ourselves the luxury of passively
	following the Community's new dynamic of integration," he says.
	    The Swiss economy ministry has drawn up a detailed analysis
	of the EC White Paper on the internal market, outlining the
	Swiss response to each point. While some refer to a collective
	EFTA stance, officials admit that on many issues Switzerland
	may have act alone.
	    The new EC plans on transport, for example, would have a
	severe impact on Switzerland and Austria, whose roads carry
	most of the traffic between Italy and its EC partners.
	    But rules such as the volume of petrol buses are allowed to
	carry across a border have much less importance to Sweden or
	Finland.
	    Switzerland wants to work out ways to help people crossing
	its borders with West Germany, France and Italy. But it is
	afraid the liberal border controls Denmark, an EC member, has
	with the non-EC Nordic countries might pose a threat to
	security.
	   And pin the fields of banking and insurance -- the very
	lifeblood of Switzerland's service sector -- Swiss interests
	could prove directly opposite to its EFTA partners with their
	pppppppnarrow and tightly protected financial markets.
	    The biggest danger ahead, EFTA members have said, would be
	that their divided interests might leave the EC free to set
	whatever guidelines and standards it wanted and force them on
	other European states that wanted to trade.

	<Exco International Plc>, a subsidiary of
	British and Commonwealth Shipping Co Plc <BCOM.L>, said it had
	agreed in principle to buy an 80 pct stake in <RMJ Holdings
	Corp> for about 79 mln dlrs.
	    Exco Chairman Richard Lacy told Reuters the acquisition was
	being made from Bank of New York Co Inc <BK.N>, which currently
	holds a 50.1 pct, and from RMJ partners who hold the remainder.
	    Bank of New York and the partners will retain about 10 pct
	each and these stakes will be bought over the next six years.
	    RMJ is the holding company of RMJ Securities, one of the
	largest U.S. Government securities brokers.
	    It is also involved in broking notes, obligations and other
	instruments sponsored by U.S. Federal agencies.
	    Lacy said Exco had been considering buying a U.S.
	Government securities broker for the past four years and had
	made an offer for RMJ when it was sold by Security Pacific Corp
	<SPC.N> in 1985. RMJ was then valued at about 50 mln dlrs.
	    B and C managing director Peter Goldie said RMJ would be
	bought at about the same multiple as Exco, suggesting net
	income of around 16 mln dlrs.
	    The company's earnings had not been hit by the halving of
	brokerage fees some 14 months ago as volumes had since doubled.
	    Lacy said that RMJ employed some 300 people, with 200 in
	the brokerage business and about 70 in its <SMS> unit, which
	provided computer software for the financial services
	community.
	    RMJ Securities had offices in New York, where total market
	turnover of U.S. Government securities was 110 billion dlrs a
	day, and in London where it has 15 billion.
	    It was also given permission last week to open an office in
	Tokyo where total market turnover had lifted rapidly to about
	five billion dlrs a day.
	    The acquisition would contribute between five and 10 pct of
	B and C's share earnings in 1987 on a proforma basis.

	AMERICAN EXPRESS SAYS ITS STRATEGY IS STABLE
TOPICS:
	
PLACES:

CONTENT:
	American Express Co's <AXP> president
	Louis Gerstner Jr. said a bear market will not effect his
	company's long-term strategy.
	    "I don't think where the market goes over any month long
	period, two day period, or even six month period has anything
	to do with our strategy," Gerstner told Reuters.
	    "We have built a strategy for our company that looks out
	over many years and anticipates a lot of change," he said.
	    Gerstner said the company's long term strategy is to build
	and maintain a major position in the financial and travel
	service industries. American Express is the 69 pct parent of
	Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc <SHE>.
	    Gerstner would not comment on the share market tailspin.
	    However, American Express chairman James Robinson said in a
	statement that the company could endure the market turbulence
	and was in a strong position for further growth.
	    "All brokerage firms make money if the market goes down or
	up," Gerstner told Reuters without elaborating.
	    Gerstner said Shearson had no plans to quit its municipal
	bond activities. "Shearson Lehman Brothers tends to adjust to
	trends in incremental steps. You will see it doing less of the
	convulsive one-time changes that people in this industry will
	go through," he said. Shearson recently laid off 150 people in
	London and is limiting hiring, but Gerstner said American
	Express remains committed to the London market and to having a
	global presence.
	    "That Shearson let a couple of hundred people go in London
	is not even an anthill on the landscape we're discussing. We
	are discussing long-term strategy," Gerstner said.
	    Earlier this year, American Express sold 13 pct of its
	stake in Shearson to Nippon Life Insurance Co of Japan and a
	further 18 pct to the public. Gerstner said these moves "had no
	implications of an exit from financial services."
	    "Our committment globally is represented by the Nippon
	tie-up which dwarfs the fact we decided to reduce the size of
	one department, in one company, in one of our subsidiaries," he
	said.
	    Many securities firms now are stressing merchant banking to
	bolster earnings hurt by bond market volatility, slow retail
	business and a drop in underwriting volume.
	    When asked if more players would make the system more
	risky, Gerstner said, "I can't comment on other firms, but
	Shearson is not going to follow a feeding frenzy in the
	direction of merchant banking. We are not going to overreach."
	    Gerstner also spoke about securitization, or the
	repackaging of debt as marketable securities.
	    "It is almost imperative to create a security backed by the
	funds flowing from an LDC (lessor developed countries) debt
	program. It is going to happen, but it is very difficult to
	create a security in the current climate," Gerstner said.
	    "Securitized products could be structured for either the
	retail or institutional markets," Gerstner said.
	    "If you look at the junk bond phenomenom, it started out
	with mostly institutional buyers. Primarily through mutual
	funds, individual buyers became a presense in the market. I'd
	guess we'd see a similiar situation in LDC debt," he said.
	    "The fundamental thing that has to happen (before there can
	be sucessful securitization) is that the debt burden on the
	countries has to be reduced, and the amount of money coming
	from the commerical banks and the future call for money on
	commercial banks has to be reduced," Gerstner said.
