	U.S. TRADE DATA SEEN AS KEY TO DOLLAR TREND
TOPICS:

CONTENT:
	The dollar's recent signs of stability
	have raised hopes that its 27-month decline may be nearly over,
	but most currency analysts refuse to commit themselves until
	after the June 12 release of U.S. trade data for April.
	    "The trade data will be a deciding factor to see if the
	dollar has bottomed out," said Jim McGroarty of Discount Corp.
	    Since February 1985, the dollar has nearly halved its value
	against the yen and the mark as part of an officially
	orchestrated campaign to make U.S. goods more competitive on
	world markets and redress gaping world trade imbalances.
	    On April 27, the dollar fell to a 40-year low of 137.25 yen
	but has enjoyed a modest recovery over the last few weeks,
	topping 145 yen today for the first time in nearly two months.
	    Many economists now believe that the dollar has fallen far
	enough to ease the trade deficit's drag on the U.S. economy.
	    The U.S. trade gap narrowed to 13.6 billion dlrs in March
	from 15.1 billion in February and is expected to show continued
	improvement in April in volume, if not in real, terms.
	    Keiichi Udagawa of Bank of Tokyo in New York said that if
	further progress is reported, the dollar would head back up
	towards 150 yen.
	    "There is growing consensus that the dollar has bottomed
	out for the medium term," added Tom Campbell of First National
	Bank of Chicago.
	    Other factors supporting this bullish view were growing
	expectations that Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker would
	be reappointed for a third four-year term in August, Japan's
	larger-than-expected economic stimulus package last week and 
	more favorably technical chart signals, analysts said.
	    The dollar was also aided by Japan's moves to dampen
	speculative selling in Tokyo and by reports of active central
	bank intervention to support the dollar.
	    The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said last week that
	the U.S. monetary authorities bought more than four billion
	dlrs during the February-April period -- the largest amount
	since the dollar crisis of the late 1970's.
	    Discount Corp's McGroarty described the Fed's intervention
	volume as "impressive".
	    James O'Neill of Marine Midland Bank was not so positive,
	however: "the dollar has not yet bottomed out. After the trade
	data are released, the dollar could fall towards 1.77 marks and
	140 yen."
	    Similarly, Natsuo Okada of Sumitomo Bank in New York
	warned, "I don't think the dollar has bottomed out yet."
	    Although the dollar could rise as high as 146.50 yen, Okada
	said market impatience about the painstakingly slow decline of
	the U.S. trade deficit may lead to renewed pressure.
	    Currency analysts also warned about an unfavorable reaction
	to the seven-nation economic Summit on June 8 to 10 in Venice,
	which is likely to focus on the implementation of previous
	commitments rather than yield any fresh initiatives.
	    President Reagan said today, "economic policy decisions
	made last year in Tokyo and at this year's meetings of Group of
	Seven finance ministers in Paris and Washington cannot be
	ignored or forgotten."
	    "The commitments made at these meetings need to be
	translated into action," he added in a speech, celebrating the
	40th anniversary of the Marshall aid plan for Europe.
	    Now that Tokyo has unveiled its fiscal stimulus package,
	analysts expected Bonn and the dollar/mark rate to bear the
	brunt of U.S. calls for further action.
	    Marine Midland's O'Neill said, "pressure will build up on
	Germany to take stimulative action like Japan."
	    Some Japanese bank dealers warned that although the dollar
	could hold above 145 yen for some months it could also come
	under attack again if it seems the latest economic package is
	not having much impact on Japan's economy and its trade
	surplus. Reflecting a longer-term uncertainty, some some trust
	banks and Japanese insurers are keeping their short dollar
	positons hedged against exchange losses in their foreign
	portfolios, while some others have started covering those short
	positions, Japanese bank dealers said.

	YEUTTER SAYS BUDGET CUT KEY TO BETTER U.S. TRADE
TOPICS:
	trade, money-fx
PLACES:
	usa, japan
CONTENT:
	A reduction of the U.S. federal budget
	deficit will be needed to help eliminate the nation's huge
	trade deficit, U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter said.
	    Speaking to the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry,
	Yeutter said "Capital and trade flows are clearly
	inter-releated now.
	    "Unless we get the budget deficit down, we will not get the
	trade deficit down."
	    He did not elaborate on his views of the linkages between
	the two deficits.
	    Private analysts have said that the financing of large U.S.
	budget deficits requires heavy capital inflows from overseas
	investors through purchases of U.S. Treasury and, to a lesser
	extent, other U.S. securities as well.
	    "We'll make some progress in reducing the 170 billion dlr
	trade deficit in 1987, but there's still a long way to go,"
	Yeutter said.
	    He said the problem must be approached on many fronts and
	focus most strongly on U.S. and overseas fiscal and monetary
	policies to foster economic growth, U.S. competitiveness and
	the establishment of a "level playing field" for trade.
	    The U.S. trade representative said the Federal Reserve
	under Chairman Paul Volcker has done its part to improve the
	trade situation by getting interest rates down.
	    On the fiscal side, Yeutter said "the budget deficit is
	still our biggest problem" and there has not been enough
	progress toward reducing that deficit.
	    In the international area, he said that "our major trading
	partners could still do more to stimulate domestic growth."
	Commenting on Japan, which is running around a 80 billion dlr
	trade surplus with the United States, Yeutter said "Japan is
	just not doing the job on the import side."
	    Yeutter declined to comment on statements relating to the
	dollar made earlier today by Commerce Dept undersecretary of
	Economic Affairs Robert Ortner.
	    In a Washington address to an Export-Import Bank sponsored
	meeting, Ortner said he believed the dollar at current levels
	was fairly priced against most European currencies, but that
	the yen is 10 or 15 pct undervalued.
	    "The market will determine the dollar's proper value in the
	end," Yeutter said. However, he added that, if the U.S. and
	other nations do not take the necessary steps to cut the U.S.
	trade deficit, "the dollar will be the equalizer."
	    Yeutter said there is no quick fix to the trade problem and
	any resort to such tactics as protectionist trade legislation
	or trade restrictions poses real dangers.
	    He said "there's relatively little that Congress can do to
	legislate a solution to the trade problem."
	    Protectionist legislation will only provoke retaliation by
	U.S. trading partners, Yeutter said.
	    "There is no doubt in my mind about the willingness of our
	trading partners to retaliate against unfair trade
	legislation," Yeutter said, adding that policy flexibility is
	essential in solving international trade problems.

	FED SEEN CONTENT WITH U.S. FEBRUARY ECONOMY
TOPICS:
	interest, gnp, ipi, wpi
PLACES:
	usa
CONTENT:
	U.S. February reports reflecting slim
	gains in industrial output and moderating inflation pressures
	reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue
	to follow a stable course of monetary policy, economists said.
	    "If you're the Fed, there's no reason to do anything," said
	Steve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities Inc.
	    "There are hints that GNP is picking up. On the inflation
	front, all is well," he said. "Money supply is well under
	control. It's an absolutely ideal situation."
	    February U.S. industrial production rose 0.5 pct, slightly
	less than the 0.7 pct gain the financial markets had expected.
	This compared with a slim 0.1 pct rise in January's production
	number, previously reported as a 0.4 pct increase.
	    The February U.S. producer price index gained only 0.1 pct,
	less than a 0.3-0.4 pct expected rise. This followed a 0.6 pct
	rise in the PPI in January.
	    "The Fed is going to look at this positively," said Allan
	Leslie of Discount Corporation. "Certainly inflation is not as
	bad as what Volcker (Fed Chairman) has said lately. Industrial
	production growth is along the lines of what the Fed wants."
	    The energy products component of PPI rose 4.0 pct in
	February, after a 9.8 pct increase in January.
	    "This shows that the impact of energy prices on inflation
	is behind us in terms of the move from 15 dlrs to 18 dlrs per
	barrel," said Maria Ramirez of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. "The
	trend is still 3.5 pct in the first half of the year."
	    In 1986, declining energy prices contributed to a 2.5 pct
	decline in the PPI.
	    Economists said that a rise in energy prices was expected,
	but a sharp drop in auto prices was not. Passenger car prices
	fell 3.4 pct and light truck prices dropped 1.3 pct.
	    Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker said that
	a possibility of renewed inflation remains a concern in both
	the financial markets and the Federal Reserve.
	    "The Fed may be lowering its own inflation expectations
	today," said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International.
	    While low inflation permits the Fed to maintain an easier
	monetary policy, Brusca said if import prices do not rise this
	could necessitate a weaker dollar.
	    "The outlook for the dollar is still up in the air," he
	said. "We need inflation for U.S. producers to compete with
	foreign producers."
	    Brusca said prices of electronic equipment dropped 0.8 pct
	in February's PPI. With many electronic goods produced
	overseas, this may show that foreign producers are not raising
	prices which bodes ill for U.S. competitiveness, he said.
	    If further dollar declines are needed, this could diminish
	overseas investment in U.S. debt, Brusca added, which might
	necessitate higher interest rates and lower bond prices.
	    By contrast, Slifer said imported goods prices rose 11.8
	pct from first quarter 1985 to first quarter 1986 reflecting to
	a large degree a 22 pct drop in the trade-weighted real value
	of the dollar from February 1985 to February 1987.
	    Slifer said import prices may rise further as
	manufacturers' contracts put in place before the dollar dropped
	to current levels expire, and new contracts are made that
	reflect a weaker dollar.
	    David Wyss of Data Resources Inc noted that imported
	manufactured goods prices rose 8.5 pct at an annual rate in the
	second half of 1986, which has contributed to rising U.S.
	industrial output.
	    "It's the other side of the lower dollar," Wyss said.
	"Producers are beginning to find themselves more competitive
	and they are increasing output."
	    Wyss said that the latest data point to an average
	industrial production gain of 0.3-0.4 pct in the first quarter.
	"It's an encouraging sign that the manufacturing sector is
	beginning to revive."
	    But Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley and Co Inc was not 
	convinced that the February reports portend economic gains. He
	said much of the strength came from factors that do not point
	to a sustained rise in industrial output.
	    Roach pointed out that stikers returning to work in farm
	equipment industries helped account for a one pct rise in
	February business equipment production.
	    Utilities output rose 0.7 pct in February after gaining 1.2
	pct in January, but Roach said it shows mostly that more energy
	was produced, not that manufacturing activity gained.
	    Finally, he pointed out that auto production accounted for
	half of the industrial production gain as production of auto
	assemblies rose to 8.3 million units at an annual rate from 7.5
	million units.
	    "In the first quarter, it looks like automakers are
	producing at an 8.5 mln unit annual rate, but selling at
	roughly a seven mln unit rate," Roach said. "The disparity
	between output and sales is showing up in inventories."
	    Economists pointed to sharp rise in January U.S. business
	inventories as a sign that production may be outstripping
	demand in the first quarter of 1987.
	    January business inventories rose 0.9 pct, the largest gain
	since July 1979 when inventories rose 1.7 pct, the Commerce
	Department said. Business sales dropped 4.5 pct in January, the
	largest monthly sales drop on record.
	    Nonetheless, economists do not expect the Fed to react to
	month-to-month changes. "The Fed has been standing pat for the
	last seven months," Ramirez said. "They will continue to stand
	pat for at least the next couple of months."

	U.S. CREDIT MARKETS MIXED AT MIDSESSION
TOPICS:
	
PLACES:
	
CONTENT:
	U.S. credit markets were mixed in dull
	trading at midsession, with moderate losses in coupon issues
	and Treasury bill rates near unchanged.
	    Bills improved slightly on remarks from Federal Reserve
	chairman Paul Volcker that a restrictive monetary policy would
	be damaging to investment and that last week's increases in
	U.S. banks' prime lending rates to 7.75 pct from 7.50 pct was
	not connected with Fed policy, dealers said.
	     Coupon issues were 1/32 to 5/16 lower, pressured by a weak
	dollar. Treasury bill rates were anywhere from three basis
	points lower to one basis point higher.
	    The key 7-1/2 pct Treasury bond was 5/16 lower at 95-26/32
	to yield 7.87 pct compared with 7.84 pct at yesterday's close.
	    Dealers said remarks from Federal Reserve Chairman Paul
	Volcker indicating that exchange rates had adjusted enough to
	narrow the U.S. trade deficit and warning that a further,
	sizable dollar fall could be counterproductive had little
	exchange rate impact as they were seen as a reiteration of his
	views.
	    In any case, they said the dollar is expected to be under
	pressure while monetary officials of leading industrial nations
	meet this week in Washington, which may hurt bonds.
	    Dealers said three-month bill rates had eased early in the
	session on a few sizable buy orders from retail accounts, but
	that otherwise there was little activity in this sector.
	    "When Volcker hit the tape it helped bills, because it
	makes people think the Fed is not going to tighten," a bill
	trader said. "But it's a nervous trade, with no real buyers."
	    Three-month bills were bid at 5.50 pct, three basis points
	below their price at yesterday's auction, while six-month bills
	rose one basis point from their auction price to 5.64 pct bid.
	    Year bills rose one basis points to 5.74 pct bid.
	    Most economists expected the Federal Reserve to supply
	temporary reserves, but most had forecasted an indirect
	injection via customer repurchase agreements rather than a
	direct injection via two-day system repurchases which the Fed
	conducted at its usual intervention time.
	    The Fed intervened when Federal funds were trading at 6-1/8
	pct. Funds opened at this level and remained there at midday,
	down from yesterday's 6.20 pct avearge.
	    The 6-3/8 pct two-year notes fell 1/32 to 99-21/32 at
	midday and the 7-1/4 pct 10-years dropped 9/32 to 97-27/32.

	SWISS ANALYSTS SAY MOOD ON MARKETS PRECARIOUS
TOPICS:
	money-fx, interest
PLACES:

CONTENT:
	Today's sharp sell-off of Swiss stocks and
	matching falls around Europe may have been overdone, but the
	mood on financial markets is precarious, Swiss securities
	analysts and economists said.
	    Panic selling took Swiss shares down six pct at the opening
	on enormous volume, triggered by the slide on Wall Street and
	the threat of renewed currency instability.
	    "I have never experienced anything like this, and I've been
	in the business for 20 years," said Bernhard Wyttenbach, head of
	European research at Union Bank of Switzerland.
	    The analysts blamed the sell-off in Europe on U.S. Monetary
	authorities. This weekend, U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker
	publicly voiced his displeasure with West German monetary
	policy. He said the eight-month-old Louvre accord to stabilise
	currencies was still working, but added: "On the other hand, we
	will not sit back and watch surplus countries jack up interest
	rates and squeeze growth on the expectation that the United
	States will raise rates."
	    Hans Peter Ast of Societe Generale Alsacienne (Sogenal) in
	Zurich said: "The situation is very dangerous. Statements by the
	U.S. Authorities have fuelled anxiety about interest rates."
	    Herbert Fritschi, director of Zurich Cantonal Bank's
	financial research department, called the sell-off "overdone,"
	but warned that the situation could worsen unless central banks
	loosen their monetary policy.
	    "I think the trend toward higher interest rates is over," he
	said. "The Federal Reserve and the Bundesbank have to step in
	with an easy money policy, or else there is going to be an
	economic catastrophe. They have to act quickly."
	    Wyttenbach said the "Black Monday" sell-off was clearly
	exaggerated, with Swiss Reinsurance Co participation
	certificates falling 20 pct in value at one point.
	    But Wyttenbach said he did not believe that a correction
	would come soon. First, the bad news will reach small investors
	only in time for tomorrow's market, when there could be
	another, smaller selling wave.
	    "As soon as the dollar stabilises -- and that's the key --
	then we'll get a strong movement upward," Wyttenbach said. But
	that may not come soon.
	    "People are simply worried that in America, where the market
	has now fallen by 18 pct since August, the bull market is over,"
	he said. "People are afraid that we'll have a recession in 1988."
	    Baker was wrong to blame the West Germans for the current
	problems and the weak dollar, Wyttenbach said. "We do not have a
	mark problem, we have a dollar problem," he added, but said the
	biggest culprit was the new chairman of the U.S. Federal
	Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan.
	    Wyttenbach recalled that Greenspan had suggested that the
	dollar might be too high in the medium term and that interest
	rates might have to rise. "As a central banker he shouldn't do
	that," Wyttenbach said. "There is a danger that we will fall back
	into the 1970s," he said. "We have a real crisis of confidence in
	Greenspan. I would much rather have a Volcker."
	    Paul Volcker retired as Fed chairman on August 11.
	    Cantonal Bank's Fritschi said: "I'm relatively optimistic
	because the situation looks too bad. The Fed certainly has to
	intervene."
	    He said he did not expect the Swiss National Bank to take
	any significant steps, adding that the focus of attention
	remains on the United States.
	    "The panic started in New York, it has to end there."
	    The Cantonal Bank sent an advisory to customers suggesting
	they not sell into a panicked market, but wait a while before
	deciding what to do.

	U.S. SEEKS JAPAN HELP IN EVENT OF 1988 RECESSION
TOPICS:
	
PLACES:
	japan, usa
CONTENT:
	Senior U.S. Officials are looking to Japan
	for help in buttressing the world economy in the event of an
	American recession next year, Japanese government sources said.
	    During a visit to the U.S. Earlier this month, Economic
	Planning Minister Tetsuo Kondo was asked by both U.S. Federal
	Reserve chairman Paul Volcker and Council of Economic Advisers
	chairman Beryl Sprinkel what Japan could do if the U.S. Enters
	recession next year.
	    Although Sprinkel indicated that he personally did not
	expect a recession next year, Volcker seemed to acknowledge
	that an economic downturn was at least a possibility, the
	sources said.
	    Faced with with a huge budget deficit, the U.S. Has little
	room to manoeuvre on fiscal policy to counteract any downturn
	that might occur in 1988.
	    It is also hamstrung as far as monetary policy is concerned
	because U.S. Inflation is already showing some signs of picking
	up, one source said.
	    But Japan is also limited in what action it could take to
	help counteract a U.S. Recession without running the risk of
	overstimulating its domestic economy and pushing up inflation,
	the sources said.
	    Money supply growth is accelerating and interest rates are
	at record low levels. In May, M-2 money supply plus
	certificates of deposit grew at a year-on-year rate of 10.2
	pct, well above nominal GNP growth of four to five pct.
	    Some government sources are also worried that the recently
	announced 6,000 billion yen emergency economic package could
	push up land prices and the construction sector's inflation.
	    Public investment spending grew at a year-on-year rate of
	about 10 pct in April, but that could accelerate to 20 pct
	later this year under the impact of the emergency package, one
	source said.
	    The 6,000 billion yen package was generally well received
	in the U.S., Although U.S. Congressmen and businessmen told
	Kondo they wanted the measures implemented quickly, sources
	said.
	    The Japanese minister explained that the acceleration of
	public works spending in the package was taking place
	immediately, they said.
	    U.S. Congressmen were particularly interested in how much
	impact the package would have on reducing the bilateral trade
	imbalance, a question which Kondo was unable to answer clearly,
	given the many economic uncertainties involved, the sources
	said.
	    While recognizing that Japan's trade surplus is falling in
	terms of volume, some Congressmen expressed concern that it was
	not falling fast enough.
	     But the sources said no one pressed Kondo for a further
	rise of the yen as a solution to correcting the bilateral trade
	imbalance.

	VOLCKER SEES TIGHT POLICY HURTING INVESTMENT

	Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul
	Volcker said a restrictive monetary policy would be damaging to
	investment and that a better course would be to restrain
	spending.
	    "A restrictive monetary policy would hit investment. You
	don't want to put interest rates up unless you have to," Volcker
	told the Senate Banking Committee.
	    "That is not a constructive way to proceed," he said.
	    Volcker said that given a choice between squeezing the
	budget deficit or squeezing investment, he would favor
	squeezing the budget deficit.
	    In response to a question about banks, Volcker said he
	would be pleased if Congress decided to give banks a tax
	writeoff as an incentive for them to take greater reserves
	against loans to debtor countries.
	    "If you give a tax writeoff for reserving against loans,
	then we will see more reserving and that would make me happy,"
	Volcker told Committee Chairman Sen William Proxmire (D-Wisc).

	U.K. BANKERS LAUD VOLCKER, UNSURE ABOUT GREENSPAN
TOPICS:
	
PLACES:

CONTENT:
	U.K. Bankers for the most part lauded
	outgoing U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker for his
	achievements over the past eight years but expressed some
	uncertainty about economist Alan Greenspan, nominated by
	President Reagan to succeed him.
	    "One of Volcker's greatest achievements was the sense of
	continuity and stability he gave to the international markets,"
	said Carlos Santistevan, executive director of Libra Bank Plc.
	However, it is uncertain how long it will take for Greenspan to
	fill that role and the degree to which he can do so, he said.
	    Greenspan heads his own financial consulting firm,
	Townesend, Greenspan Associates Inc and was Chairman of the
	Council of Economic Advisers during the Ford Administration.
	    "He is a prominent and well known figure in the U.S." said
	David Lomax, Group Economics Adviser at National Westminster
	Bank Plc, who described Greenspan as an "orthodox Republican
	economist" who may be better suited to getting the U.S. Economy
	on track than Volcker.
	    But for the most part bankers in London are unfamiliar with
	Greenspan's views on domestic and international economics or
	the international debt crisis.
	    "I will be sad to see Volcker go. He is a central banker of
	good repute with a general interest in protecting the U.S. And
	international banking system," said Libra's Santistevan.
	    Volcker knows and understands the problems facing indebted
	countries, he said, adding that it is unlikely Greenspan is as
	familiar with the problem and the personalities involved.
	    For this reason he expects there will be little change in
	the Fed's approach to the debt crisis, even as U.S. Commercial
	banks take a harder line in dealing with the problem by adding
	billions of dollars in reserves against possible losses on
	third world debt.
	    Another senior banker who deals with the Latin American
	debt problem also doubted there would be much change
	post-Volcker, but for other reasons.
	    He said that despite U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker's
	debt initiative which called for greater contributions by
	banks, governments and multilateral organization, government's
	have done little to try to improve the situation, leaving the
	bulk of the responsibility in the hands of the bankers.
	    Despite the Fed's independence from central government, he
	questioned how much impact Greenspan could have coming into the
	job so close to the next Presidential election.
	    News that Volcker would not seek a third term hit the
	financial markets hard.  The U.S. Dollar fell sharply on
	foreign exchange markets before reported concerted central bank
	intervention by the Fed and the Bundesbank helped it recover
	somewhat. Prices of Eurodollar denominated bonds fell about one
	point, while prices of U.S. Treasury bonds traded here lost
	more than one point.
	    But despite the disruption in the markets, Lloyds Bank
	Plc's Group Economic Adivser Christopher Johnson said the
	announcement was well-timed, given the recent rise in the
	dollar against the mark and yen.
	    In recent statements U.S. Officials have said the dollar
	has fallen far enough and at a White House briefing today
	announcing his nomination Greenspan said "there certainly is
	evidence" that the dollar had bottomed out.
	    However, many economists here believe that the recent rise
	in the dollar will be only temporary and that it will have to
	fall further before America's huge trade deficit begins to
	reverse.
	    "The dollar has further to fall, although it may take a few
	years" said Lloyds Bank's Johnson. He added that the important
	thing is that there is a soft landing.
	    Like other economists, Johnson is anxious to hear
	Greenspan's testify at the Congressional confirmation hearings.
	    "He has everything going for him but he must establish
	credibility. We have to hear his views on inflation and the
	outlook for interest rates," he said.
	    Some bankers criticized Volcker for taking too hard a
	stance in combating inflation in the late 1970's when his
	tightening in U.S. Monetary policy pushed interest rates to
	record levels.
	    "He tightened more than the Republicans wanted and only
	relaxed his stance when the Latin American debt crisis erupted
	(in 1982)," National Westminster's Lomax said.
	    Lomax said that Greenspan, if appointed, will inherit the
	agreements entered into by Volcker with other members of the
	Group of Five industrial nations on the dollar.
	    However, he said that the danger lies in dollar stability
	being maintained because of a monetary policy that is too
	tight. Too firm a monetary policy could send the U.S. Into
	recession, which would not be welcome by European counterparts,
	he said.

	VOLCKER DEPARTURE REVIVES DLR, INFLATION FEARS

	Paul Volcker's decision not to go for a
	third term as Federal Reserve Chairman and the nomination of
	Alan Greenspan to replace him have revived deep concerns about
	the U.S.' ability to prevent a further dollar decline and stem
	rising inflation, financial market analysts said.
	    Although Greenspan is known as a committed anti-inflation
	fighter in the Volcker mould, doubts are already surfacing in
	the U.S. financial markets as to whether he has enough
	political clout and monetary experience to wage a tough
	campaign against inflation over the next year or two.
	    "The critical issue is how (Greenspan) will deal with
	inflation," said Stephen Axilrod, Vice Chairman of Nikko
	Securities Co International Inc and former staff director for
	monetary and financial policy at the Fed.
	    "A lot of questions have been raised by Volcker's
	departure. Until Greenspan answers them, the markets will
	remain nervous," added Stephen Slifer, money market economist
	at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc.
	    This morning's announcement sent the dollar into a
	tailspin, which was halted only by concerted central bank
	intervention in the open currency market.

	INFLATION STILL A CONCERN, VOLCKER SAYS

	Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul
	Volcker said both the Fed and the financial markets remain
	concerned about the possibility of renewed inflation.
	    "A possibility of renewed inflation remains of concern,
	both in the markets and within the Federal Reserve," he said in
	remarks prepared for delivery to a group of business leaders
	here.
	    He said one potential channel for renewed inflationary
	pressures would be an excessive fall of the dollar in the
	exchange markets, which would push import prices up sharply.
	    He said participants in financial markets and business
	remain skeptical of prospects for lasting price stability.
	    "Should the skepticism about our ability to resist
	inflation be reinforced by bad policy, the consequences for
	interest rates, for exchange rates, and for the economy
	generally would clearly be undesirable...recognition of that
	danger neccesarily must weigh heavily in the formation of
	monetary policy," the Fed chairman said.
	    Volcker said attempts to drive the dollar much lower would
	undermine the hard won gains against inflation and would risk
	dissipating the flow of foreign capital.
