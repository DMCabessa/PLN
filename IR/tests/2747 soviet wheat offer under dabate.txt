	MORE SOVIET GRAIN BUYING FROM U.S. TIED TO PRICE

CONTENT:
	Whether the Soviet Union will fulfill
	its buying obligations under the U.S./USSR grains agreement
	depends entirely on the United States, a Soviet trade official
	told Reuters.
	    "How can I tell that we are ready to fulfill the agreement
	if the United States does not want to offer us grain at
	competitive prices?" said Albert Melnikov, deputy trade
	representative of the Soviet Union to the United States.
	    "We are in the market for grains, but it is up to the
	United States to be the seller ... to offer Soviets competitive
	prices," he said in an interview.
	    Melnikov said that the United States has not lived up the
	agreement by failing to make available to Moscow U.S. grain at
	prevailing market prices.
	    "We are being accused of not implementing this agreement.
	We do not consider we are at fault," Melnikov said.
	    Article I in the agreement states that "purchases/sales of
	commodities under this Agreement will be made at the market
	price prevailing for these products at the time of
	purchase/sale and in accordance with normal commercial terms."
	    "The United States should supply to the Soviet Union
	definite quantities of grain at competitive prices ... Is the
	United States ready to supply this?" he said.
	    The Soviet official said that near-term corn demand has
	been met by the recent Soviet purchases of U.S. corn, which he
	confirmed at 1.5 mln tonnes, but said that if U.S. corn prices
	remain competitive, the Soviets will buy more if they need it.
	    Wheat buying, however, is a different story, Melnikov said.
	    "If the United States is interested in selling its wheat,
	then they must offer competitive prices, and it's up to the
	United States to decide how these competitive prices will be
	offered," he said.
	    Last year's U.S. offer of subsidized wheat to the Soviets
	was rejected because of an insufficient subsidy, Melnikov said.
	He said that at the time of the 13 dlr per tonne subsidy offer,
	U.S. wheat prices were 26 dlrs over world levels.

	ANALYSTS SAY USSR MAY PREFER NEW CROP U.S. WHEAT
TOPICS:
	grain, wheat
PLACES:

CONTENT:
	The Soviet Union would likely be more
	interested in purchasing new crop wheat than in booking any
	grain for immediate shipment if offered a subsidy on U.S.
	wheat, an executive with a major grain export company said.
	    Lower prices and the desire to delay any big purchases
	until the condition of winter and spring crops is better known
	make new crop wheat more attractive, said George Hoffman,
	director of commodity analysis for The Pillsbury Company.
	    "Pillsbury is assuming that they (Soviets) will be offered
	a subsidy and that it will be a subsidy that they can respond
	to," Hoffman told Reuters in an interview at an agribusiness
	education conference here. But if there are too many
	constraints placed on a subsidy offer, the USSR will take less
	than an anticipated four mln tonnes, he said.
	    Hoffman said Pillsbury's internal statistics put Soviet
	Union wheat purchases at only two mln tonnes under a subsidy
	offer. However, if a subsidy is offered at competitive levels,
	Moscow would likely buy more, he said.
	    "If we give the Soviets the same deal as the Chinese, I
	expect they'll take it," said Vernon McMinimy, director of
	commodity research for A.E. Staley Manufacturing Co.
	    McMinimy told Reuters spring weather and its impact on
	crops will determine how much wheat Moscow would buy under a
	subsidy offer.
	    Soviet winter crops did not get off to a good start because
	of a dry autumn last year, and because of the severe winter
	"they probably have had more damage due to winter weather than
	normal," McMinimy said.

	U.S. WHEAT BONUS TO SOVIET CALLED DORMANT
TOPICS:

PLACES:

CONTENT:
	The U.S. Agriculture Department is not
	actively considering offering subsidized wheat to the Soviet
	Union under the export enhancement program (EEP), senior USDA
	officials said.
	    However, grain trade analysts said the proposal has not
	been ruled out and that an offer might be made, though not in
	the very near future.
	    "The grain companies are trying to get this fired up again,"
	an aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said. "But there
	just isn't much talk about it, informally or formally."
	    Most analysts interviewed by Reuters were more confident
	than USDA officials that bonus wheat would be offered to the
	Soviets, even though U.S. officials did not make such an offer
	when they held grain talks with Soviet counterparts earlier
	this week.
	    But administration and private sources agreed that if the
	Reagan administration did decide to offer subsidized wheat to
	Moscow, it could take several months.
	    "I just don't see any proposal like that sailing through any
	interagency process," the aide to Lyng said.
	    "An export enhancement offer is not consummated overnight,"
	said one former USDA official, who noted that the
	administration took three months to decide in favor of selling
	China wheat under the subsidy program.
	    An official representing a large grain trade company said
	deliberations within USDA might be nudged along by members of
	Congress, a number of whom urged USDA this week to make a wheat
	subsidy offer to the Soviets.
	    But Lyng's aide said that during a day-long visit to
	Capitol Hill yesterday, House members did not press the
	secretary on the subsidy question a single time.
	    The administration's interagency trade policy review group,
	comprised of subcabinet-level officials, has not been asked to
	clear a request to offer Moscow wheat under the EEP, officials
	at the U.S. Trade Representative's Office said.
	    In their talks this week, the two sides discussed the
	administration's previous EEP offer but did not talk about any
	new initiative. One USDA official who took part in the
	consultations this week described them as an exchange of "calm,
	basic, factual economics."
	    Another USDA official said there was "not even an informal
	suggestion or hint" that the Soviets would live up to their
	pledge to buy four mln tonnes of wheat this year if they were
	granted more favorable terms.
	    USDA and private sources agreed that consideration of an
	EEP initiative by interagency review groups likely would be
	delayed because of disarray within the White House stemming
	from the Iran arms affair.

	SHULTZ NOT OPPOSED TO WHEAT SUBSIDY TO SOVIETS
TOPICS:

CONTENT:
	Secretary of State George Shultz has
	decided not to oppose any U.S. wheat subsidy offer to the
	Soviet Union and has left the final decision on whether to sell
	subsidized wheat to Moscow up to President Reagan and the
	Agriculture Department, a State Department official said.
	    "Shultz feels like he fought the battle against a subsidy
	last summer, and he's not going to the mat again. It's now
	basically the USDA who has to make their decisions as to what
	they want to do," the official said.
	    If USDA decides to go ahead with a subsidy offer to the
	Soviet Union, he said, "Shultz will not wage a vigorous
	campaign against it. He might not come out in favor of it, but
	he won't go to the President and voice his objections."
	    In an official statement clarifying Shultz's remarks
	yesterday to leaders of the National Association of Wheat
	Growers, the State Department said, "Secretary Shultz expressed
	his belief that whenever possible, U.S. grain should be
	competitive on world markets, including the Soviet Union.
	    The Agriculture Department is in the best position to
	determine whether consideration should be given at this time to
	extending to the Soviets a subsidy under the Export Enhancement
	Program."
	    Although Shultz will not oppose a wheat subsidy to the
	Soviets, there remain obstacles to another subsidy offer to
	Moscow, the State Department official said.
	    "Everyone in the government agrees that if there is a
	subsidy to be offered, we would not offer it unless we had a
	firm commitment from the Soviets that they would buy."
	    USDA does not want a repetition of last summer when the
	USSR baulked at its offer of four mln tonnes of subsidized
	wheat, the official, who asked not to be identified, said.
	    The Soviets rejected the U.S. offer then on the grounds
	that the 13 dlr per tonne subsidy was insufficient to bring
	U.S. prices down to competitive levels.
	    The Soviets want a higher subsidy offer this time, the
	State Department source said.
	    "What the Soviets want is something equivalent to the
	lowest price being paid by anyone in the world," he said.
	    The Soviets argue that they are the best customer of the
	U.S. and that they are entitled to the best price, he said.
	    Government and commodity sources also said there are
	elements in the USDA, most notably undersecretary Daniel
	Amstutz, who remain opposed to a wheat subsidy to the Soviets.
	    "Subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union is still not a
	foregone conclusion," the State Department official said.

	U.S. HOUSE PANEL EXTENDS EEP, URGES USSR OFFER
TOPICS:

PLACES:

CONTENT:
	The U.S. House Agriculture Committee
	approved proposals to extend the life of the Export Enhancement
	Program, EEP, through fiscal 1990 and urged the Reagan
	administration offer EEP wheat to the Soviet Union.
	    The proposals were approved as amendments to a
	comprehensive trade bill moving through Congress this year.
	    In addition to the amendments on EEP, the committee
	approved several proposals which could restrict imports of
	lamb, casein, sugar-containing products and tobacco. Those
	amendments affecting imports face an uncertain future because
	the House Ways and Means Committee, which has overall
	jurisdiction over trade legislation, will oppose them,
	Congressional sources said.
	    The effect of the EEP amendments would be to extend the
	life of the program five years through fiscal 1990 rather than
	the current three years through fiscal 1988.
	    The amendments, offered by Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., also
	would increase funding for the program to 2.5 billion dlrs from
	1.5 billion now.
	    Furthermore, the committee passed an amendment offered by
	Rep. Glickman which instructs the U.S. Agriculture Department
	to value EEP bonus commodities at market value, not acquisition
	value. Glickman said the change would make the program 30 pct
	less expensive to operate.
	    The provision on EEP wheat to the Soviet Union, offered by
	Rep. Bob Smith, R-Ore., does not require the administration
	make an offer, but urges such action.
	    The committee approved an amendment, offered by Rep. Glenn
	English, D-Okla., requiring the Secretary of Agriculture to
	begin discussions with other major grain producing countries
	aimed at jointly reducing world grain production.
	    Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter yesterday opposed the
	amendment, saying such commodity agreements do not work.
	    Among the host of amendments to restrict imports approved
	by the panel, the most significant would require quotas on
	imports of goods containing more than 25 pct of a bulk farm
	product that is subject to U.S. quotas. The amendment, offered
	by Rep. Arlan Stangeland, R-Minn., is aimed primarily at
	curbing imports from Canada of products containing sugar and
	foreign foods containing dairy products. It also may affect
	peanut, cotton and tobacco imports, Committee sources said.
	    Another amendment would place a quota on U.S. imports of
	casein, a dairy product shipped to the U.S. primarily by New
	Zealand and Ireland.
	    The panel also voted to apply to lamb imports the same
	countercyclical import quota law which is operating for U.S.
	beef imports.
	    Other miscellaneous amendments included:
	    -- Urging the administration consider retaliating against
	Japan and South Korea if those countries do not remove
	restrictions on beef imports.
	    -- Boosting the amount of U.S. grain which must be shipped
	each year under a food aid program called Section 416 to
	800,000 tonnes from 500,000 tonnes now.
	    -- Requiring the Agriculture Secretary conduct a study of
	the Canadian Wheat Board import licensing system for wheat to
	determine if it is a non-tariff trade barrier.
	    -- Requiring the Agriculture Secretary reimburse the
	National Corn Growers Association up to 500,000 dlrs for the
	costs of defending the U.S. feedgrains program against a
	Canadian countervailing duty case this year.
	    -- Urging the administration oppose the Canadian decision
	to apply a duty on U.S. corn imports, and a proposal by the
	European Community to apply a vegetable oils tax.
	    -- USDA conduct a study of the findings of a National
	Commission on Agricultural Export Policy, which recommended a
	reorganization of USDA's trade policy apparatus.

	SHULTZ USSR TRIP FUELS TALK OF EEP WHEAT OFFER
TOPICS:

CONTENT:
	Speculation the United States will
	offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union appears to have
	reached a new level of intensity in the run-up to Secretary of
	State George Shultz' visit later this month to Moscow.
	    Rumors of an impending deal have coursed through wheat
	markets since officials from the two countries held their
	customary, semi-annual grain talks in February. Moscow's
	decision at that time to reenter the U.S. corn market
	strengthened the perception of warming farm trade prospects.
	    Shultz is set to arrive in Moscow April 13.
	    Shultz' statement two weeks ago that he would not stand in
	the way of a wheat subsidy offer under the Export Enhancement
	Program, EEP, coupled with the announcement of his visit to
	Moscow, was interpreted by many grain trade representatives
	here as a clear signal that the Reagan administration was
	preparing an offer.
	    Administration officials -- in and out of the U.S.
	Agriculture Department -- have been extremely tight-lipped
	about the prospects of a subsidy offer.
	    But USDA officials for the most part have abandoned the
	contention the proposal is dormant, suggesting that an offer,
	while not a "done deal," is a live possibility.
	    Prominent U.S. grain trade representatives -- many of whom
	asked not to be identified -- continue to maintain that an
	offer to subsidize four mln tonnes of wheat is imminent.
	    Others, who one month ago claimed a deal was not possible,
	are saying they would not rule one out.
	    Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., yesterday went so far as to
	predict a subsidy offer would be made within the next ten days
	to two weeks.
	    Aides to Roberts said he had spoken to Republican leaders
	who had been in contact with administration officials.
	    Richard Fritz, director of international marketing at U.S.
	Wheat Associates, said he was confident an export enhancement
	offer would be made by the middle of this month.
	    Fritz also said he thought the value of the bonus would end
	up being close to the offer Washington made Peking earlier this
	year when USDA approved subsidies to China of around 36 dlrs
	per tonne on one mln tonnes of wheat.
	    Some grain trade representatives say a four-mln-tonne wheat
	subsidy offer might help stimulate more Soviet purchases of
	U.S. corn and open the door to U.S. sales of soybeans.
	    As ever, one of the crucial sticking points in a wheat deal
	would appear to be price.
	    Last summer the administration took the controversial step
	of offering the Soviets subsidized wheat -- but were
	embarrassed when Moscow spurned the proposal on the grounds
	that the 15-dlr-per-tonne subsidy still left U.S. wheat prices
	far above world market prices.
	    The administration's decision to set the subsidy level up
	front instead of accepting bids from exporters appeared to be a
	means of controlling the price while attempting to dampen
	criticism, grain trade sources said.
	    Nonetheless, the pricing procedure did not prevent Shultz
	from saying the Soviets were "chortling" because Washington was
	offering Soviet housewives cheaper grain than that available to
	U.S. housewives.
	    The conventional wisdom among grain trade representatives
	here is that a general warming of relations between the two
	countries since last summer, combined with continued hard times
	in the U.S. grain belt, would favor a subsidy offer.
	    In addition, the USSR has made it clear it would consider
	buying U.S. wheat if it were priced more competitively.
	    However, observers have not forgotten the circumstances
	surrounding the administration's announcement of the wheat
	subsidy offer last summer.
	    Up until the time of the announcment, congressional and
	industry leaders were led to believe the White House had
	decided to expand the Export Enhancement Program to include not
	only the Soviets, but also a much broader list of countries.
	    Instead, the administration scaled back the offer to
	include only the Soviets.
	    That last-minute change of heart adds a measure of
	uncertainty even to the predictions of those most convinced
	that the administration will not now pass up the opportunity to
	sell four mln tonnes of wheat to the Soviet Union.

	U.S. GRAIN TRADE CALLS SHULTZ REMARK SIGNIFICANT
TOPICS:

PLACES:

CONTENT:
	A statement yesterday by Secretary
	of State George Shultz after he met with wheat growers that
	U.S. agricultural products must be competitively priced was
	significant in that he recognized the importance of the Soviet
	market and the need for U.S. prices to be at world market
	levels, U.S. grain trade industry officials said.
	    They said that Shultz's comments, while not explicitly
	endorsing subsidized wheat sales to the USSR, were noteworthy
	because they were not negative towards such action.
	    In response to a query on what the State Department's
	position is on selling subsidized wheat to Moscow, Shultz told
	the leaders of the National Association of Wheat Growers that
	prices must be competitive if the U.S. is going to trade.
	    The Soviet Union, the world's largest grain importer, has
	bought no U.S. wheat for more than a year, complaining the
	price was far above world market levels. A U.S. offer last fall
	to sell the Soviets lower-priced wheat through the export
	enhancement program, EEP, was also rebuffed due to the price.
	    Shultz was said to be adamantly against the U.S. wheat
	offer last year and has been reported to be one of the major
	obstacles in making another subsidy overture to the Soviet
	Union, grain industry sources said.
	    Intense speculation the U.S. might make a fresh EEP wheat
	offer to the Soviets has boosted grain prices significantly in
	recent trading sessions. Kansas City hard wheat futures rose
	another 2-1/4 cents by midday at 2.88-1/4 dlrs per bushel,
	while CBT March wheat was up 1-1/2 cents at 2.92-1/2 dlrs.
	    "I'm not sure this is an about-face, but it's clearly a
	recognition that unless we're competitive, we won't sell to the
	Soviet Union," said a lobbyst for a major commodity group.
	    "We have to be competitive. It's ridiculous to say that
	somebody is going to buy your product if they can get the same
	thing at a lower price somewhere else," Shultz told the farm
	leaders. "That is our approach in negotiations with the
	Soviets," he said.
	    If those comments do signal that the State Department is no
	longer opposed to the U.S. selling wheat to the USSR under EEP,
	it certainly improves the chances for an EEP wheat offer to
	Moscow, an industry lobbyst said.
	    National Wheat Grower's officials were taking a cautious
	attitude towards the secretary's comments.
	    "His comments were not discouraging, but they didn't in our
	judgment promise any immediate action on EEP," an official with
	the wheat group said.
	    The Wheat Growers official noted, however, that "there is
	significance in that fact that we haven't seen any significant
	negative commentary on the idea of EEP wheat to the Soviets."
	    In a meeting with exporters this week, Secretary of
	Agriculture Richard Lyng refused to comment on their request
	that the administration offer subsidized wheat to Moscow, the
	officials said.
	    An aide to USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz, who is
	reported to be strongly opposed to EEP wheat to the Soviets,
	said that the Shultz comments "are consistent with what he
	(Shultz) has taught for years as an economist," but said they
	don't necessarily relate to the Soviet Union.
	    Amstutz could not be reached for comment, and an aide to
	Lyng said Lyng would not comment on Shultz's statements.
	    But trade sources were hopeful that the Shultz comments may
	indicate some movement towards EEP wheat to Moscow.
	    "If he didn't say no, then there's a chance. This is
	potentially a positive development," a commodity source said.

	U.S./SOVIET GRAIN MEETING UNLIKELY THIS SUMMER
TOPICS:

CONTENT:
	Prospects appear slim for a summer
	meeting between U.S. and Soviet officials before the two
	countries enter the final year of their bilateral grains
	agreement, Agriculture Department officials said.
	    The two sides usually try to meet as each new year of the
	agreeement approaches although the last meeting was delayed up
	to last February. However, any delay this year should not
	endanger the fifth year of the grains agreement that extends
	through September, 1988, USDA officials said.
	    "It will be difficult to pull together the people for the
	meeting during July," an aide to USDA undersecretary Daniel
	Amstutz said.
	    Since the last meeting was only around four months ago, the
	next talks could still be a "couple more months," he said.
	   
	    There has been grain industry speculation that the USDA
	will offer Moscow another wheat subsidy during the next
	marketing year. But USDA officials said even if consultations
	were held soon a subsidy offer would probably not be made.
	    "I doubt that there would be any subsidy offer this summer
	or before the next agreement year begins," a USDA source said.
	    Citing limited subsidy funds and uncertainties about next
	year's crops, he said, "There are too many variables now. It
	would be uncharacteristic of us to make an offer now."
	    Under the nonbinding pact, Moscow has agreed to purchase a
	minimum of nine mln tonnes of U.S. grain per year. Soviet and
	U.S. officials normally meet in the summer before the start of
	a new agreement year to discuss grain quality, shipping
	logistics and production outlooks.

	SHULTZ SAYS U.S. WHEAT BONUS OFFER UP TO USDA
TOPICS:
	grain, wheat

CONTENT:
	U.S. Secretary of State George
	Shultz said it was up to the Agriculture Department to decide
	whether to offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union.
	    Shultz told the Newspaper Farm Editors of America that a 
	wheat bonus offer to the Soviet Union "is something that I
	basically leave to the Agriculture Department to figure out."
	    Last year, Shultz spoke out against President Reagan's
	decision to offer subsidized U.S. wheat to the Soviet Union --
	an offer Moscow spurned.
	    "I've always been a little put off by the idea that we would
	arrange our food supplies so as to price them in such a way
	that the Soviet housewife could buy American-produced food for
	less than the American housewife could buy it," Shultz said.
	    "It also seems to me that if we are going to sell in world
	markets, we have to meet the price," he added.
	    Shultz called proposals to broaden the eligibility criteria
	of USDA's export enhancement program (EEP) to include all U.S.
	customers "questionable."
	    An across-the-board EEP would mark a "considerable change" in
	the current program, which Shultz said is designed "to say to
	other countries that subsidize, particularly the European
	Common Market, that we're not going to give up our markets to
	those subsidized sales and we'll have a little kit bag that
	will meet that competition and hold our markets for our
	farmers."
	    "If you just go across-the-board and subsidize everything,
	that's a different order of program and seems to me quite
	questionable," he said.
