	SHULTZ USSR TRIP FUELS TALK OF EEP WHEAT OFFER

CONTENT:
	Speculation the United States will
	offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union appears to have
	reached a new level of intensity in the run-up to Secretary of
	State George Shultz' visit later this month to Moscow.
	    Rumors of an impending deal have coursed through wheat
	markets since officials from the two countries held their
	customary, semi-annual grain talks in February. Moscow's
	decision at that time to reenter the U.S. corn market
	strengthened the perception of warming farm trade prospects.
	    Shultz is set to arrive in Moscow April 13.
	    Shultz' statement two weeks ago that he would not stand in
	the way of a wheat subsidy offer under the Export Enhancement
	Program, EEP, coupled with the announcement of his visit to
	Moscow, was interpreted by many grain trade representatives
	here as a clear signal that the Reagan administration was
	preparing an offer.
	    Administration officials -- in and out of the U.S.
	Agriculture Department -- have been extremely tight-lipped
	about the prospects of a subsidy offer.
	    But USDA officials for the most part have abandoned the
	contention the proposal is dormant, suggesting that an offer,
	while not a "done deal," is a live possibility.
	    Prominent U.S. grain trade representatives -- many of whom
	asked not to be identified -- continue to maintain that an
	offer to subsidize four mln tonnes of wheat is imminent.
	    Others, who one month ago claimed a deal was not possible,
	are saying they would not rule one out.
	    Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., yesterday went so far as to
	predict a subsidy offer would be made within the next ten days
	to two weeks.
	    Aides to Roberts said he had spoken to Republican leaders
	who had been in contact with administration officials.
	    Richard Fritz, director of international marketing at U.S.
	Wheat Associates, said he was confident an export enhancement
	offer would be made by the middle of this month.
	    Fritz also said he thought the value of the bonus would end
	up being close to the offer Washington made Peking earlier this
	year when USDA approved subsidies to China of around 36 dlrs
	per tonne on one mln tonnes of wheat.
	    Some grain trade representatives say a four-mln-tonne wheat
	subsidy offer might help stimulate more Soviet purchases of
	U.S. corn and open the door to U.S. sales of soybeans.
	    As ever, one of the crucial sticking points in a wheat deal
	would appear to be price.
	    Last summer the administration took the controversial step
	of offering the Soviets subsidized wheat -- but were
	embarrassed when Moscow spurned the proposal on the grounds
	that the 15-dlr-per-tonne subsidy still left U.S. wheat prices
	far above world market prices.
	    The administration's decision to set the subsidy level up
	front instead of accepting bids from exporters appeared to be a
	means of controlling the price while attempting to dampen
	criticism, grain trade sources said.
	    Nonetheless, the pricing procedure did not prevent Shultz
	from saying the Soviets were "chortling" because Washington was
	offering Soviet housewives cheaper grain than that available to
	U.S. housewives.
	    The conventional wisdom among grain trade representatives
	here is that a general warming of relations between the two
	countries since last summer, combined with continued hard times
	in the U.S. grain belt, would favor a subsidy offer.
	    In addition, the USSR has made it clear it would consider
	buying U.S. wheat if it were priced more competitively.
	    However, observers have not forgotten the circumstances
	surrounding the administration's announcement of the wheat
	subsidy offer last summer.
	    Up until the time of the announcment, congressional and
	industry leaders were led to believe the White House had
	decided to expand the Export Enhancement Program to include not
	only the Soviets, but also a much broader list of countries.
	    Instead, the administration scaled back the offer to
	include only the Soviets.
	    That last-minute change of heart adds a measure of
	uncertainty even to the predictions of those most convinced
	that the administration will not now pass up the opportunity to
	sell four mln tonnes of wheat to the Soviet Union.

	    Speaking at a House foreign agriculture subcommittee,

	    Rep. Roberts said there had been some talk that the issue
	of an eep to Moscow had not been raised within the Reagan
	administration recently because Secretary of State George
	Shultz was out of the country.
	    "That very well may be the case," said Tom Kay, U.S.
	Agriculture Department Foreign Agricultural Service
	administrator. However, Kay told Reuters later that his reply
	to Roberts was not based on any particular knowledge.
	    Rep. Roberts urged Kay to convey to top officials of the
	USDA that some in Congress favor a wheat eep to Moscow.
	    "I'd be delighted to deliver the message," Kay replied.
	    Earlier, Kay had repeated Agriculture Secretary Richard
	Lyng's statement last week that "the door is not yet closed on

	U.S. GRAIN TRADE CALLS SHULTZ REMARK SIGNIFICANT
TOPICS:
	grain, wheat
PLACES:
	usa, ussr
CONTENT:
	A statement yesterday by Secretary
	of State George Shultz after he met with wheat growers that
	U.S. agricultural products must be competitively priced was
	significant in that he recognized the importance of the Soviet
	market and the need for U.S. prices to be at world market
	levels, U.S. grain trade industry officials said.
	    They said that Shultz's comments, while not explicitly
	endorsing subsidized wheat sales to the USSR, were noteworthy
	because they were not negative towards such action.
	    In response to a query on what the State Department's
	position is on selling subsidized wheat to Moscow, Shultz told
	the leaders of the National Association of Wheat Growers that
	prices must be competitive if the U.S. is going to trade.
	    The Soviet Union, the world's largest grain importer, has
	bought no U.S. wheat for more than a year, complaining the
	price was far above world market levels. A U.S. offer last fall
	to sell the Soviets lower-priced wheat through the export
	enhancement program, EEP, was also rebuffed due to the price.
	    Shultz was said to be adamantly against the U.S. wheat
	offer last year and has been reported to be one of the major
	obstacles in making another subsidy overture to the Soviet
	Union, grain industry sources said.
	    Intense speculation the U.S. might make a fresh EEP wheat
	offer to the Soviets has boosted grain prices significantly in
	recent trading sessions. Kansas City hard wheat futures rose
	another 2-1/4 cents by midday at 2.88-1/4 dlrs per bushel,
	while CBT March wheat was up 1-1/2 cents at 2.92-1/2 dlrs.
	    "I'm not sure this is an about-face, but it's clearly a
	recognition that unless we're competitive, we won't sell to the
	Soviet Union," said a lobbyst for a major commodity group.
	    "We have to be competitive. It's ridiculous to say that
	somebody is going to buy your product if they can get the same
	thing at a lower price somewhere else," Shultz told the farm
	leaders. "That is our approach in negotiations with the
	Soviets," he said.
	    If those comments do signal that the State Department is no
	longer opposed to the U.S. selling wheat to the USSR under EEP,
	it certainly improves the chances for an EEP wheat offer to
	Moscow, an industry lobbyst said.
	    National Wheat Grower's officials were taking a cautious
	attitude towards the secretary's comments.
	    "His comments were not discouraging, but they didn't in our
	judgment promise any immediate action on EEP," an official with
	the wheat group said.
	    The Wheat Growers official noted, however, that "there is
	significance in that fact that we haven't seen any significant
	negative commentary on the idea of EEP wheat to the Soviets."
	    In a meeting with exporters this week, Secretary of
	Agriculture Richard Lyng refused to comment on their request
	that the administration offer subsidized wheat to Moscow, the
	officials said.
	    An aide to USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz, who is
	reported to be strongly opposed to EEP wheat to the Soviets,
	said that the Shultz comments "are consistent with what he
	(Shultz) has taught for years as an economist," but said they
	don't necessarily relate to the Soviet Union.
	    Amstutz could not be reached for comment, and an aide to
	Lyng said Lyng would not comment on Shultz's statements.
	    But trade sources were hopeful that the Shultz comments may
	indicate some movement towards EEP wheat to Moscow.
	    "If he didn't say no, then there's a chance. This is
	potentially a positive development," a commodity source said.

	SHULTZ NOT OPPOSED TO WHEAT SUBSIDY TO SOVIETS
TOPICS:
	grain, wheat
PLACES:

CONTENT:
	Secretary of State George Shultz has
	decided not to oppose any U.S. wheat subsidy offer to the
	Soviet Union and has left the final decision on whether to sell
	subsidized wheat to Moscow up to President Reagan and the
	Agriculture Department, a State Department official said.
	    "Shultz feels like he fought the battle against a subsidy
	last summer, and he's not going to the mat again. It's now
	basically the USDA who has to make their decisions as to what
	they want to do," the official said.
	    If USDA decides to go ahead with a subsidy offer to the
	Soviet Union, he said, "Shultz will not wage a vigorous
	campaign against it. He might not come out in favor of it, but
	he won't go to the President and voice his objections."
	    In an official statement clarifying Shultz's remarks
	yesterday to leaders of the National Association of Wheat
	Growers, the State Department said, "Secretary Shultz expressed
	his belief that whenever possible, U.S. grain should be
	competitive on world markets, including the Soviet Union.
	    The Agriculture Department is in the best position to
	determine whether consideration should be given at this time to
	extending to the Soviets a subsidy under the Export Enhancement
	Program."
	    Although Shultz will not oppose a wheat subsidy to the
	Soviets, there remain obstacles to another subsidy offer to
	Moscow, the State Department official said.
	    "Everyone in the government agrees that if there is a
	subsidy to be offered, we would not offer it unless we had a
	firm commitment from the Soviets that they would buy."
	    USDA does not want a repetition of last summer when the
	USSR baulked at its offer of four mln tonnes of subsidized
	wheat, the official, who asked not to be identified, said.
	    The Soviets rejected the U.S. offer then on the grounds
	that the 13 dlr per tonne subsidy was insufficient to bring
	U.S. prices down to competitive levels.
	    The Soviets want a higher subsidy offer this time, the
	State Department source said.
	    "What the Soviets want is something equivalent to the
	lowest price being paid by anyone in the world," he said.
	    The Soviets argue that they are the best customer of the
	U.S. and that they are entitled to the best price, he said.
	    Government and commodity sources also said there are
	elements in the USDA, most notably undersecretary Daniel
	Amstutz, who remain opposed to a wheat subsidy to the Soviets.
	    "Subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union is still not a
	foregone conclusion," the State Department official said.

	U.S. Secretary of State George
	Shultz said it was up to the Agriculture Department to decide
	whether to offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union.
	    Shultz told the Newspaper Farm Editors of America that a 
	wheat bonus offer to the Soviet Union "is something that I
	basically leave to the Agriculture Department to figure out."
	    Last year, Shultz spoke out against President Reagan's
	decision to offer subsidized U.S. wheat to the Soviet Union --
	an offer Moscow spurned.
	    "I've always been a little put off by the idea that we would
	arrange our food supplies so as to price them in such a way
	that the Soviet housewife could buy American-produced food for
	less than the American housewife could buy it," Shultz said.
	    "It also seems to me that if we are going to sell in world
	markets, we have to meet the price," he added.
	    Shultz called proposals to broaden the eligibility criteria
	of USDA's export enhancement program (EEP) to include all U.S.
	customers "questionable."
	    An across-the-board EEP would mark a "considerable change" in
	the current program, which Shultz said is designed "to say to
	other countries that subsidize, particularly the European
	Common Market, that we're not going to give up our markets to
	those subsidized sales and we'll have a little kit bag that
	will meet that competition and hold our markets for our
	farmers."
	    "If you just go across-the-board and subsidize everything,
	that's a different order of program and seems to me quite
	questionable," he said.

	Asked what the U.S. State
	Department's policy is on offering subsidized wheat to Moscow,
	Secretary of State George Shultz told a group of farm leaders
	that U.S. products must be competitive in the world market.
	    "If we are going to sell our products, whatever they may

	    Schultz said that while he does not favor a situation that
	would allow the Soviet housewife to buy food cheaper than the
	American housewife, he realizes the importance of American
	agricultural products being competitively priced.
	    Speculation has been in the market for some time that the
