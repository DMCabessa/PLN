	HK BANK EXPECTED TO POST 10 TO 13 PCT PROFIT RISE
TOPICS:

CONTENT:
	The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp
	<HKBH.HK> is likely to show a rise in profit of between 10 and
	13 pct for 1986, reflecting stronger than expected loan growth,
	share analysts polled by Reuters said.
	    Their estimates of the bank's net earnings for last year
	ranged from 2.99 to 3.1 billion H.K. Dlrs. Results will be
	announced on Tuesday. The 1985 net profit was 2.72 billion.
	    They forecast a final dividend of 29 cents for a total of
	42 cents for the year against 38 cents in 1985, adjusted for a
	one-for-five bonus issue.
	    Analysts said they expected the bank to recommend a bonus
	issue this year, probably one for three or one for five.
	    The bank's 61.5 pct subsidiary Hang Seng Bank Ltd <HSGH.HK>
	is to report its 1986 results on Friday.
	    Analysts expect Hang Seng to announce net profit of more
	than one billion dlrs for the first time, an increase of 10 to
	12 pct.
	    They expect Hang Seng to pay a final dividend of 1.37 dlrs
	for a total of 1.75 dlrs for the year against 1.60 in 1985.
	    Analysts said that while the use of undisclosed inner
	reserves by banks here makes forecasting very imprecise,
	Hongkong Bank benefited from the unexpected strength of the
	Hong Kong economy in 1986, when gross domestic product grew by
	nearly nine pct against an initial forecast of 4.5 pct.
	    "They benefited considerably from the pickup in loan demand,
	as their loan portfolio is well balanced," an analyst at Mansion
	House Securities (F.E.) Ltd said.
	    Government figures show that total loans and advances rose
	by 13.8 pct in 1986, compared with a 4.5 pct increase in 1985.
	    Loans to finance Hong Kong's visible trade, the mainstay of
	the local economy, rose by 15.1 pct against a decline of five
	pct in 1985.
	    Low interest rates also helped the bank. Interest received
	on loans was low, with the prime rate at 6.5 pct at end-1986,
	but interest paid on savings was two pct. Hongkong Bank and
	Hang Seng Bank control half of all deposits in the banking
	system, giving them access to a large base of low-cost funds.
	    The strength of the real-estate market was another major
	income source for the bank group. Loans to finance property
	development and instalment mortgages rose sharply.
	    "The Hongkong Bank group is still the leader in mortgage
	business despite tough competition from the Bank of China group
	and other foreign banks," one analyst said.
	    The high level of activity on the capital and equities
	markets in 1986 contributed to a sharp improvement in Hongkong
	Bank subsidiaries Wardley Ltd <WAIA.HK> and <James Capel and
	Co>, analysts said. "Wardley had a tremendous year acting as
	financial adviser and underwriter," an analyst said.
	    Wardley was underwriter for last year's billion-dlr
	flotation of <Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd>, of which Hongkong
	Bank owned 30 pct at the time.
	    The bank's stake has since been cut to 16.4 pct in return
	for 1.57 billion dlrs. It also sold its entire 48.8 pct stake
	in <South China Morning Post Ltd>, the larger of two
	English-language daily newspapers here, for 1.18 billion dlrs.
	    The proceeds will go to reserves for acquisitions and will
	not show up in the profit and loss accounts, analysts said.
	    Analysts said the bank had also been helped by a reduced
	need to write off bad debts. "The need for provisions was much
	lower than the year before," said Tony Measor of Hong Leong
	Securities Co Ltd. "Last year's profits should have been 2.8 to
	2.9 billion dlrs if not for the huge provisions."
	    Former Hongkong Bank chairman Michael Sandberg said the
	bank wrote off hundreds of millions of dollars against its
	shipping exposure in 1985. Lesley Nickolds of County Securities
	Asia Ltd said she saw no major shipping writeoffs in 1986. She
	forecast profit of 2.99 billion dlrs.
	    The bank's Latin American exposure, mainly through its
	51-pct owned Marine Midland Banks Inc <MM>, appears to have
	improved substantially, analysts said. Marine Midland's 1986
	fourth-quarter loan-loss provisions fell to 44.1 mln U.S. Dlrs
	from 89.2 mln a year before. Its 1986 net profit rose to 145
	mln U.S. Dlrs from 125 mln in 1985.

CONTENT:
	Purolator Courier corp's stock rose on
	specualtion that a disgruntled former Purolator director would
	find a new suitor for the company, traders said.
	    Purolator agreed in late February to a 35 dlr-a-share, 265
	mln-dlr offer from E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and certain members of
	its Purolator courier division's management.
	    The stock today hit 36-1/4, up one.
	    Today, Purolator revealed in a filing with the Securities
	and Exchange Commission that director Doresy Gardner resigned
	from its board of directors in a letter dated March 10.
	    The letter from Gardner said he resigned the board because
	the merger agreement with Hutton barred directors from
	soliciting new offers and he believes shareholders might get a
	better deal. Gardner said he believes a better offer might be
	found if the company would agree to be sold to some other
	entity, or if it could sell off all or part of its U.S. courier
	division.
	    "Basically, (the courier division) is a company that has
	450 mln dlrs in revenues. It's a very large company and it's
	being sold for 50 or 60 mln dlrs," said Gardner in a telephone
	interview with Reuters.
	    Gardner is an official of Kelso Management, a firm
	associated with Fidelity International Ltd. A group of Fidelity
	companies owns eight pct of Purolator, and Gardner said he
	personally owns 20,000 shares.
	    A Purolator official said the company has no comment on the
	letter from Gardner.
	    Arbitragers speculated another overnight messenger service
	may emerge as a likely bidder for Purolator. Before the
	transaction with Hutton LBO was announced, analysts had also
	speculated another courier company would be the most likely
	suitor.
	    While one arbitrager acknowledged there in fact may be no
	new bidders, he said the possibility one could appear pushed
	the stock into play again.
	    "There's no shortage of possibilities. It's just a question
	of management's willingness to let the process continue," said
	one arbitrager.
	    Arbitragers said a new buyer might be found because they
	believe Hutton LBO has taken on no risk in the transaction.
	Hutton has begun a tender for 83 pct of Purolator at 35 dlrs
	cash per share. The balance of Purolator's stock will be bought
	for securities and warrants in a new company holding the U.S.
	courier operations.
	    The arbitragers said tender offer documents show that
	Hutton does not need to use its cash in the transaction and
	will emerge with a giant, majority equity interest in
	Purolator.
	    "As far as I can tell from the public documents from the
	deal that's on the table, Hutton is basically putting up zero.
	One always likes a situation like that. You always like to
	think if they can do this deal at no risk, there should be
	someone else in the world that could do it higher," said one
	arbitrager.
	    The firm, however, is supplying temporary financing, and
	sources close to the transaction disputed the claim that the
	firm will not end up paying for its equity position.
	    While one scenario mentioned in the tender offer document
	did note that the E.F. Hutton Group subsidiary may not have to
	keep cash in the transaction, the sources said there is some
	risk to the firm.
	    "There are a variety of contingencies and restricted cash,
	and all sorts of things that make it very speculative," said
	one of the sources, adding there are also severance payments to
	employees.
	    The E.F. Hutton Group subsidiary is supplying 279 mln dlrs
	in so-called "bridge" financing for the transaction. The bridge
	financing is a temporary loan from Hutton.
	    The financing is to be replaced with permanent financing,
	expected to come from banks. However, it may take some time to
	replace the financing, the source said, resulting in what could
	be a substantial expense to the firm.
	    Gardner said Hutton stands to gain fees of 10 to 20 mln
	dlrs from the transaction, but sources close to the transaction
	said fees are at the low end of the scale.
	    "It's a very complex transaction, but basically what
	happens is they ostensibly put up money but the fees recapture
	any investment they might have once the merger takes place,"
	Gardner said.

	Indonesia has increased its share in a

	    The Japanese Export-Import Bank said Indonesia had raised
	its share of (P.T. Indonesia Asahan Aluminium) company,
	capitalised in 1975 at 91 billion, by swapping 32 billion yen
	in government loans to the company for an equity stake.
	    The Japanese shareholders, the Overseas Economic
	Cooperation Fund and 12 companies, are to invest another 24
	billion yen raising capitalisation to 147 billion yen.
	    Asahan reported total losses of 97.6 billion rupiah between
	1982 and 1985. Suhud said much of the company's 320 billion yen
	debt had been caused by falling tin prices and the appreciation
	of the yen against the U.S. Dollar. Aluminium is sold in
	dollars.
	    Prices improved from 1,150 dlrs a tonne six months ago to
	about 1,450 dlrs today. The plant is supposed to break even if
	prices stay at 1,500 dlrs a tonne.
	    Sahud said the plant, with a capacity of 220,000 tonnes a

	American Express Co said it was
	subpoenaed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in
	connection with documents on transactions in securities of
	American Express and its former unit, Fireman's Fund.
	    American Express said its brokerage unit, Shearson Lehman
	Brothers Inc was also served with a subpoena. Shearson acted as
	co-manager in the underwriting of units of Fireman's common
	stock and warrants last May, was also served with a subpoena,
	it said.
	    American Express said the subpoena to Shearson relates to
	transactions with Jefferies and Co and others.
	    American Express said it and Shearson intend to comply with
	all requests from the SEC and to cooperate fully. American
	Express said neither company is aware of any unlawful conduct
	with respect to the matters and a thorough investigation is
	continuing.
	    American Express said the subpoenas were received
	yesterday, and that it and Shearson were unaware of any inquiry
	prior to receiving the subpoenas.
	    Yesterday, Boyd Jefferies, founder of Jefferies Group, said
	he agreed to plead guilty to two felony counts of securities
	violations.
	    Jefferies also settled charges with the Securities and
	Exchange Commission of market manipulation and another scheme
	with Ivan Boesky, who has settled SEC charges of insider
	trading.
	    Jefferies' firm was censured by the SEC and ordered to
	retain an outside consultant to review its procedures.
	    In documents filed on Jefferies yesterday, the SEC did not
	identify who was involved in the market manipulation scheme
	aside from Jefferies. It said "a certain issuer," which held
	controlling interest in a second public company, offered
	several mln shares of the company's common stock to the public
	in a secondary offering during 1986.
	    The SEC alleged that Boyd Jefferies carried out a scheme
	with an unidentified person to drive up the price of the second
	company's stock prior to the offering by having the Jefferies
	firm trade in the stock.
	    Jefferies and co was allegedly compensated for the loss
	from those trading activities after sending a fake invoice to
	another unnamed person, the government charged.
	    American Express first offered Fireman's Fund Corp's stock
	to the public in 1985. It lowered its holding from 100 pct to
	41 pct. In May, 1986, it reduced its ownership interest to 27
	pct by completing a public offering of nine mln units.
	    Each unit consisted of one share of common and one warrant
	to buy Fireman's fund. The warrants are exercisable from the
	issue date through March, 1989.
	    At the same time, American Express sold warrants directly
	to Fireman's Fund to purchase five mln shares. Those warrants
	are exercisable between November, 1988 and March 1991.
	    American Express said if all warrants were exercised it
	would own about 13 pct of Fireman's fund.
	    American Express stock fell 1-1/2, to 77-1/4 on volume of
	1.9 mln shares. The stock had been strong in the last two days,
	first on rumors, then an announcement of an understanding
	American Express reached to sell Nippon Life Insurance Co 13
	pct of Shearson.
	    Wall Street has also been anticipating American Express
	will sell a stake in the brokerage unit to the public as well.
	    E.F. Hutton analyst Michael Lewis said he does not believe
	the subpoenas will affect Nippon's deal with American Express,
	but it could result in a delay of the public offering
	anticipated for Shearson.
	
	    "If they're forced to keep a bigger percentage of Shearson
	a little longer...big deal. They're certainly not going to
	throw Shearson away. Shearson is still an attractive asset," he
	said.
	    American Express has not commented on speculation it would
	offer part of Shearson to the public, but it has said it was
	continuing to review options for the brokerage.
	    Analysts had speculated an offering of a part of Shearson
	would be forthcoming shortly.
	    "It puts a cloud over it for a while...The market is
	anxious to see them consumate whatever they were going to
	consumate," Lewis said.

	Takeover speculation buoyed Wendy's
	International Inc's stock, even after Coca Cola Co took the
	fizz out of market rumors by denying it was an interested
	suitor.
	    Wendy's retreated from an earlier high of 13-3/8, and lost
	a point when Coca Cola <KO> said the rumors were untrue.
	However, Wendy's remained up 5/8 at 12-3/8 on volume of more
	than three mln shares.
	    Several analysts were skeptical of the rumors, yet they
	said they could not conclude a takeover of the fast food
	restaurant chain was impossible.
	    Wendy's declined comment on takeover rumors of all kinds.
	Yet, a Wendy's spokesman said the company was aware of a
	Business Week article, which named Coke as a potential suitor
	and which market sources said helped ignite the rumor mill.
	    Market sources mentioned Anheuser-Busch Inc <BUD> and
	Pepsico Inc <PEP> as alternatives to Coke as acquirers. Neither
	of those companies would comment, nor would the Wendy's
	official.
	    "It doesn't happen every day, every week, every month, but
	its not unusual for us to be linked with those companies," said
	Denny Lynch, Wendy's vice president of communications.
	    However, Lynch would not comment specifically on the
	current market rumors.
	    Even before Coke denied the rumors, analysts had been
	skeptical of a takeover since Atlanta-based Coke has stated it
	views fast food chains as customers and does not want to become
	a competitor to them.
	    "I can't put another name on it," said Kidder peabody
	analyst Jay Freedman as vaguer rumors continued to hold up
	Wendy's stock. "It very well could be someone's interested."
	    But Freedman said he doesn't believe now is the right time
	for Wendy's to be sold.
	    "They're obviously having operational difficulties. I've
	always believed at the right price Wendy's would consider (an
	offer), but I can't believe this is the right price at the
	right time," Freedman said.
	    "If a transaction takes place, the buyer's going to control
	the situation," Freedman said.
	    "I just don't think there's anything going on. I don't
	think it's worth much more than where it is," said Joseph Doyle
	of Smith Barney.
	    Analysts said Wendy's has suffered largely from the "burger
	wars" between itself, McDonald's Corp <MCD> and Pillsbury Co's
	<PSY> Burger King chain. Wendy's, the third largest fast food
	hamburger chain in the U.S., lost about 11 pct in same store
	sales last year, analysts said.
	    Wendy's also fumbled when it introduced a high-priced
	breakfast, which it has since withdrawn, analysts said. Some
	analysts said the company should be bringing in new products,
	but it is too soon to predict a significant turnaround.
	    There are analysts, however, who believe Wendy's may be
	vulnerable to a takeover.
	    James Murren of C.J. Lawrence said Wendy's could be worth
	14 to 15 dlrs on a break-up basis. He said the company has
	improved its debt-to-equity ratio and Wendy's owns a high
	percent of its own restaurants - 38 pct of 3,500.
	    "They also have some attractive leaseholds on their
	restaurants," Murren said.
	    Murren said that despite the downturn in sales last year,
	Wendy's real sales, store for store, turned upwards in the
	fourth quarter. "That was about the first time in seven
	quarters," he said.
	    Caroline Levy of E.F. Hutton also believes something could
	be going on with Wendy's. "My gut feeling is something's going
	to happen. I don't know what," she said.
	    She estimated a takeover price would be at least 15 dlrs
	per share.
	    One analyst speculated that Coke became the rumored suitor
	because Wendy's decided to sell Coke at its fountains instead
	of Pepsi.
	    Wendy's is currently embroiled in litigation brought by
	Pepsi, which holds a contract with the company, analysts said.
	Pepsi's soda is still sold in the Wendy's restaurants.

	willing to bid 36.50 dlrs.
	    For Conrac, the arbitrageur said, 28 dlrs per share seemed
	like an "appropriate price." Another said "it's too early to
	project the outcome."
	    "The market is speaking for itself and saying the 25 dlr
	offer is inadequate," the second arbitrageur said. But he added
	it was hard to make a case for Conrac being worth much more
	than the 29 dlrs where the shares traded today.
	    He noted the stock recently sold in the high teens and
	there could be a downward risk of 10 dlrs or more if Conrac is
	able to thwart Mark IV.
	    Conrac urged shareholders to take no action while its board
	studies the offer and confers with advisers. Conrac said it
	would make a recommendation by April 17.
	    A third arbitrageur noted Mark IV had been involved in
	several takeovers previously and has proven itself to be a
	determined bidder. "They're not beginners," he said.
	    Another said Conrac might have trouble if it tried to find
	another buyer. "It's a hodge-podge of non-related businesses,"
	he said. "There is only a small universe of people who would
	want to own the company as it's presently structured."
	    Conrac is involved in video displays, computer software,
	aircraft instruments, telephone answering machines, welding
	equipment and other products.
	    "I'm telling retail clients to sell and leave the rest for
	those who can take the risk," said Rudolph Hokanson, analyst at
	Milwaukee Co.
	    He called the 25-dlr offer by Mark IV "fair value but on
	the low side." "I don't think management was looking for a
	buyer in any way before this offer," he said.
	    Hokanson said Conrac has conservative finances and has
	developed a reputation for quality products that serve niche
	markets. He said management has done a good job of turning
	around the telephone answering machine business.

TITLE:
	DOME PETE<DMP> SAID TO BE PRESSED TO SELL ENCOR
TOPICS:
	acq
PLACES:
	canada
CONTENT:
	Dome Petroleum Ltd is under pressure
	from one of its largest creditors, <Canadian Imperial Bank of
	Commerce>, to sell its 42 pct stake in <Encor Energy Corp Ltd>,
	energy industry analysts said.
	    Dome has pledged its 42.5 mln Encor shares as security for
	part of its debt to Commerce Bank, estimated last year at 947
	mln Canadian dlrs, and the bank wants Dome to sell the stock to
	pay down debt, analysts said.
	    "The Commerce has been slowly but surely moving Encor in the
	direction that might make it a saleable asset," said one analyst
	who asked not to be named.
	    Dome earlier said it was not considering selling Encor
	Energy, but reaffirmed the company's 23.3 pct interest in
	Canadian gold producer Dome Mines Ltd <DM> is up for sale "at
	the right price."
	    Dome, now negotiating a plan to restructure more than 6.10
	billion dlrs in debt, sees Encor as a strategic investment that
	it does not intend to sell, spokesman David Annesley said. The
	Encor shares do not pay dividends.
	    A Commerce Bank spokesman also declined comment when asked
	whether it is pressing Dome to sell its Encor stake.
	    At current market prices, Dome's stake in Encor would be
	valued at about 308 mln dlrs, while its 20.9 mln Dome Mines
	shares would be worth about 319 mln dlrs.
	    Recent strength in the price of Encor shares may also
	prompt Commerce Bank to press Dome to divest its holding in the
	Canadian oil and gas producer, analysts said.
	    "Encor's stock price has improved quite substantially in
	recent weeks with a runup in crude prices," Peters and Co Ltd
	oil analyst Wilf Gobert commented.
	    "The possibility is that Commerce Bank would like to see it
	sold at these levels because they can get more for it now than
	they have been able to in recent years," he added.
	    Encor traded earlier on the Toronto Stock Exchange at
	7-1/8, near its 52-week high of 7-1/2 and up from around six
	dlrs in early February.
	    The company also recently set up its own operating
	management, which was previously carried out by Dome Petroleum,
	Maison Placements Canada Inc analyst Denis Mote commented.
	    Dome and Encor "are actually going to get farther apart. So
	(the sale) does make a lot of sense," Mote said.
	    However, analysts said Dome will resist any moves to divest
	Encor in favor of retaining the operating assets since sale
	proceeds would likely go directly to pay down Dome's debt to
	Commerce Bank.
	    "I think they'll probably try to hang onto Encor as long as
	they can," said Bache Securities Inc analyst Doug Weber.
	    Some of Dome's group of 56 major creditors might move to
	block such a sale, arguing they have a claim on company assets.
	    "Other creditors generally all want to make sure that
	something they might be able to get a piece of is not being
	sold out from under them," said analyst Gobert.
	    Another stumbling block would be Encor's 225 mln dlr joint
	liability in loans to Dome Petroleum advanced by Arctic
	Petroleum Corp of Japan for Beaufort Sea exploration.
	    Analysts said a similar hurdle could also hinder the
	possible sale of Dome Petroleum's interest in Dome Mines.
	    Dome Mines has guaranteed 225 mln dlrs of Dome Petroleum's
	debt and has a "right of consent" to the sale of Dome Petroleum's
	holding.
	    Presumably, a potential buyer of the Dome Mines shares
	would seek some type of relief on the company's debt
	obligations connected with Dome Petroleum, Gobert said.
	    Dome spokesman Annesley earlier declined to specify at what
	price the company would consider selling its Dome Mines shares,
	but said current prices of more than 15 dlrs a share "are very
	attractive."

	PUROLATOR <PCC> DIRECTOR QUITS OVER BUYOUT

	A Purolator Courier Corp director
	resigned from the company's board, saying he plans to take
	steps to make or find an offer that tops the 265 mln dlr buyout
	deal already accepted by Purolator's board, the company said.
	    The director, Doresy Gardner, resigned in a March 10 letter
	to the Purolator board, which was included in a filing made by
	the company to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
	    Gardner noted that the terms of the merger agreement in
	which the company would bought out by a group of its managers
	and E.F. Hutton LBO Inc bar directors from taking action to
	solicit, initiate or encourage acquisition proposals.
	    "I, as a shareholder, wish to solicit, initiate or
	encourage such an offer or indication of interest, and believe,
	therefore, that I should resign as a director of the
	corporation," Gardner said in the letter.
	    "Accordingly, I hereby resign as a director of Purolator
	Courier Corp, effective immediately," he said.
	    Gardner said he believes shareholders could get a better
	deal than the buyout offer if the company would agree to be
	sold to some other entity, or if it could sell off all or part
	of its U.S. courier division.
	    On March 4, another Purolator shareholder, Rodney Shields,
	filed a class action suit on behalf of the company's
	shareholders charging the company and its board with breaching
	their fiduciary duty by failing to take steps to ensure that
	shareholders got the highest possible price in the buyout.
	    The deal would give shareholders 35 dlrs a share in cash if
	just 83 pct of Purolator's 7.6 mln shares are tendered. If more
	are tendered, they would receive 29 dlrs in cash and six dlrs
	in debentures and a warrant to buy stock in the new company in
	exchange for each share.

	BALLY <BLY> SEEN SELLING OFF HEALTH UNIT
TOPICS:
	earn, acq
PLACES:
	usa
CONTENT:
	Bally Manufacturing Corp's proposed
	public offering of 24 pct of its Health and Tennis Corp unit is
	seen as the first step towards the sale of the entire unit,
	analysts said.
	    "In the longer-term horizon, Bally wants to concentrate on
	its gaming businesses," said analyst Dennis Forst of Seidler
	Amdec Securities Inc.
	    Last week, Bally said it was considering the sale of
	another non-casino unit, its Six Flags amusement park unit,
	which analysts said could fetch about 300 mln dlrs.
	    Bally spokesman Bill Peltier said "the company currently
	has no hard plans to the sell any more of the health club
	company, but in the long term we'll wait and see how the
	offering goes."
	    Once Bally's biggest revenue producer, the health club unit
	had 1986 operating income of 60 mln dlrs on revenues of 456.2
	mln dlrs, 28 pct of Bally's revenues. Analysts estimate the
	unit could be sold for for 300-500 mln dlrs.
	    Analysts said Bally's decision to offer shares in the unit
	could be the first step to selling it.
	    "It would seem obvious that an offering would decrease the
	health club unit's debt, increase its cash flow and operating
	income, making it an attractive buy to a third party," Steven
	Eisenberg of Bear Stearns said.
	    On Monday, Bally said it filed with the Securities and
	Exchange Commission for an initial offering of 24 pct, or 5.8
	mln shares, of the unit's common stock at 13-15 dlrs a share.
	   About half the proceeds, 40 mln dlrs, will be used to reduce
	parent Bally Manufacturing's debt which has swelled to 1.6
	billion dlrs due to recent hotel acquisitions and the purchase
	of shares from Donald Trump who had threatened a hostile
	takeover, according to Bally treasurer Paul Johnson.
	    Remaining proceeds from the stock offering and from a
	separate offering of 50 mln dlrs of 20-year convertible
	subordinated debt would be used to repay about 75 mln dlrs of
	short term senior bank debt of the health chain unit, a Bally
	spokesperson said.
	    Analysts said Bally's health club unit's profits have
	remained strong, but are skeptical about the industry's long
	range prospects.
	    "The fitness club industry, over the last 10 years, has
	grown tremendously, but the question is whether its a fad or a
	permanent part of our lifestyle," said Eisenberg of Bear
	Stearns.
	    Analysts said fitness clubs will likely flourish if the
	public stays at its peak of health consciousness, but that
	overcapacity is likely to occur as consumer enthusiasm wanes.
	     In addition, "the returns in the fitness club industry are
	just not as high as they are in the gaming industry," said one
	analyst.
	     There are about 6,500 fitness clubs in the U.S., excluding
	clubs run by not-for-profit organizations, according to the
	Association of Physical Fitness Centers who estimates it to be
	an 8.0-billion-dlr-a-year industry.
	     Asked if anyone has offered to buy the unit, which is the
	nation's largest health club chain, Peltier said, "no one has
	the money to offer to buy it."
	    "The fitness industry is a fragmented industry with no
	leader and there is a great opportunity for growth through
	acquisition and then standardization," said Wayne LaChapelle,
	chief financial officer of Livingwell INc <WELL>, the nation's
	second largest fitness chain operator whih
	    LaChapelle said Livingwell is always interested in
	acquisition opportunities but "could not afford an acquisition
	the size of Bally at this time."
