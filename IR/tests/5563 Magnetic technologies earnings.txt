	KODAK <EK> HAS NEW DATA STORAGE, USAGE SYSTEMS
TOPICS:
	
PLACES:

CONTENT:
	Eastman Kodak Co said it is introducing
	four information technology systems that will be led by today's
	highest-capacity system for data storage and retrieval.
	    The company said information management products will be
	the focus of a multi-mln dlr business-to-business
	communications campaign under the threme "The New Vision of
	Kodak."
	    Noting that it is well-known as a photographic company,
	Kodak said its information technology sales exceeded four
	billion dlrs in 1986. "If the Kodak divisions generating those
	sales were independent, that company would rank among the top
	100 of the Fortune 500," it pointed out.
	    The objective of Kodak's "new vision" communications
	campaign, it added, is to inform others of the company's
	commitment to the business and industrial sector.
	    Kodak said the campaign will focus in part on the
	information management systems unveilded today --
	    -- The Kodak optical disk system 6800 which can store more
	than a terabyte of information (a tillion bytes).
	    - The Kodak KIMS system 5000, a networked information
	management system using optical disks or microfilm or both.
	    -- The Kodak KIMS system 3000, an optical-disk-based system
	that allows users to integrate optical disks into their current
	information management systems.
	    -- The Kodak KIMS system 4500, a microfilm-based,
	computer-assisted system which can be a starter system.
	    Kodak said the optical disy system 6800 is a
	write-once/ready-many-times type its Mass Memory Division will
	market on a limited basis later this year and in quantity in
	1988.
	    Each system 6800 automated disk library can accommodate up
	to 150, 14-inch optical disks. Each disk provides 6.8 gigabytes
	of randomly accessible on-line storage. Thus, Kodak pointed
	out, 150 disks render the more-than-a-terabyte capacity.
	    Kodak said it will begin deliveries of the KIMS system 5000
	in mid-1987. The open-ended and media-independent system 
	allows users to incorporate existing and emerging technologies,
	including erasable optical disks, high-density magnetic media,
	fiber optics and even artificial intelligence, is expected to
	sell in the 700,000 dlr range.
	    Initially this system will come in a 12-inch optical disk
	version which provides data storage and retrieval through a
	disk library with a capacity of up to 121 disks, each storing
	2.6 gigabytes.
	    Kodak said the KIMS system 3000 is the baseline member of
	the family of KIMS systems. Using one or two 12-inch manually
	loaded optical disk drives, it will sell for about 150,000 dlrs
	with deliveries beginning in mid-year.
	    The company said the system 3000 is fulling compatibal with
	the more powerful KIMS system 5000.
	    It said the KIMS system 4500 uses the same hardware and
	software as the system 5000. It will be available in mid-1987
	and sell in the 150,000 dlr range.

	Rumors that New York investor Asher
	Edelman has acquired a stake in Polaroid Corp and optimism
	about tomorrow's status hearing on the patent infringement suit
	pending with Eastman Kodak Co <EK> sent Polaroid's stock
	higher, traders said.
	    Polaroid rose 1-1/8 to 74-1/2.
	    "Speculation that Edelman was going to take a stake in
	Polaroid was kicking around a few months ago, and resurfaced
	today," one trader said.
	    Edelman had no comment on the rumors.
	    A spokesman for Polaroid said the company had not been
	contacted by Edelman and no filing had been made with the
	Securities and Exchange Commission about a stake in the
	company.
	    "There is some hope among investors that there will some
	progress in the status hearing tomorrow on the patent
	infringement suit with Kodak," analyst Michael Ellmann of
	Wertheim and Co said.
	    Traders said it is conceivable that a trial date could be
	set or some progress made on an out-of-court settlement.
	    The suit, filed by Polaroid in April 1976, charges that
	Kodak infringed upon Polaroid's instant camera patent. In
	October 1985, the court barred Kodak from selling cameras or
	film that infringe upon the patent, the Polaroid spokesman
	said.
	    Ellmann said he feels it is highly unlikely that any
	progress will be made in tomorrow's hearing.
	    Ellmann said the stock may have also gotten a boost today
	from some optimism concerning new products the company is
	currently working on.
	    "Polaroid's announcement that a particularly senior company
	executive had been chosen to work on a major unidentified new
	product spurred some speculation about their products," he
	said. "I am speculating that the new product could be an
	electronic still camera," referring to a camera that records
	its images on magnetic disks as opposed to conventional film.

	SUPERCONDUCTOR RESEARCH MAY BOOST TOKYO STOCKS
TOPICS:
	
PLACES:
	japan
CONTENT:
	Research into materials that conduct
	electricity with minimal resistance could lead to further gains
	on Tokyo's booming stock market, brokers said.
	    They said the share prices of companies likely to benefit
	from the so-called 'superconductors' rose sharply last week
	after publication of articles about the research in the
	economic daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun. The companies were in the
	non-ferrous metal, electrical and mining sectors.
	    But industry analysts said development problems remain and
	commercial application is still some years away.
	    "The area clearly has significant applications but it won't
	be commercially viable for a few years," said Thomas Murtha,
	technology analyst with James Capel and Co.
	    Industry analysts said the use of superconductors could
	bring sharp cuts in electricity costs if present problems can
	be overcome.
	    Nikko Securities Co Ltd analyst Shinichi Nakayama said
	superconductors could have applications in computer circuitry,
	electricity generation and storage, and scientific research.
	    The superconductors are made of a blend of metals fused in
	a heat-firing process similar to that used in ceramics.
	    Nakayama said Kawasaki Steel Corp <KAWS.T> predicted in an
	in-house study that by 1990 the worldwide market would be worth
	150 billion yen for superconductors used in computers, 50
	billion for those used in electricity generators and 150
	billion for those used in electricity storage.
	    The study said that by 1995 there would be trains capable
	of 500 km an hour, hovering on a magnetic field and powered
	mainly by superconductors. One hundred billion yen worth of
	superconducting material would be needed for such a train.
	    The Kawasaki study also said superconductors would be used
	in nuclear fusion physics, but not until the year 2000.
	    Industry analysts said superconductors have no commercial
	applications at present. In laboratory tests the conductor must
	be cooled by expensive liquid helium or hydrogen before minimum
	electrical resistance is achieved, though liquid nitrogen,
	which is much less expensive, has recently also been used
	successfully, they said.
	    Despite this, investors on Tokyo's stock market have
	boosted shares of firms related to superconducting materials.
	    From the close of trading on March 17 until yesterday's
	close, Mitsubishi Mining and Cement Co Ltd's <MIMI.T> share
	price rose 140 yen to 485 yen.
	    In the same period Mitsubishi Metal Corp <MITM.T>, rose 95
	to 745 yen, Sumitomo Metal Mining Co Ltd <TOMM.T> rose 200 to
	1440 yen, and Kawasaki Steel rose 15 to 260.
	    Furukawa Electric Co Ltd shares <URUT.T> jumped 104 yen to
	689 yen, and Fuji Electric Co Ltd <FUJE.T> rose 141 to 619.
	    Brokers said shares of suppliers of scientific instruments
	needed to conduct the superconductor research also rose.
	    Industry analysts said the most favoured superconductor,
	made from a blend of yttrium, barium and copper, is currently
	undergoing laboratory tests under a scheme coordinated by the
	Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI).
