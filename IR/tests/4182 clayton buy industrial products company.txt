	US SAYS CANADIAN, ISRAELI PACTS SHOULD SPUR TRADE
TOPICS:

PLACES:

CONTENT:
	Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter
	said on Monday that the U.S. free trade agreements with Canada
	and Israel should help to pave the way for liberalizing the
	global trading system.
	    He said the Canadian and Israeli pacts will not set back
	worldwide reform efforts under the General Agreement on Tariffs
	and Trade (GATT) as some critics feared but help them.
	    The GATT talks began a year ago in Punta del Este, Uruguay
	to liberalize the global trading system and to include in it
	trade in agriculture and services such as banking.
	    Yeutter made his remarks at a U.S.-Israeli trade meeting
	marking the second year of their bilateral accord. The
	Canadian-U.S. pact, signed by two sides two weeks ago, has yet
	been approved by the U.S. Congress and Canadian Parliament.
	    The two free trade agreements (FTA) would gradually remove
	tariffs and other barriers to cross-border trade in goods and
	many services.
	    Yeutter said in the aftermath of the Canadian and Israeli
	pacts "other countries have realized that if they want to
	continue to have access to the world's largest market, they had
	better get serious about improving the GATT."
	    The pact with Israel, he said, is gradually increasing
	shipments both ways and the Canadian pact will substantially
	increase the gross national products in both countries.
	    Yeutter also said the Canadian and Israeli pacts should
	serve as important precedents for progress in GATT.
	    Yeutter said, "increasing trade is one of the keys to
	enhanced political and economic stability around the globe."
	    He said, "a stronger GATT will enhance prosperity, not only
	for advanced industrial nations, but also for other countries
	that need to increase trade in order to better their standards
	of living."
	    Yeutter added it was important not to risk the progress
	made in the Israeli and Canadian trade pacts by resorting to
	protectionism.
	    He was referring to trade legislation pending in Congress
	that would force the United States to take retaliatory actions
	against nations with large trade surpluses with the United
	States if the countries practiced unfair trade.
	    The legislation was prompted by a growing U.S. trade
	deficit that hit 156 billion dlrs last year and is still
	rising.
	    Yeutter said the pressures for Congress to act were hard to
	resist, but the pending legislation would undermine President
	Reagan's efforts to liberalize the world trade.
	    Yeutter renewed the threat of a White House veto.
	    He said, "President Reagan will veto any bill that contains
	serious flaws, and I believe that veto would be sustained."

	U.S. TO PUSH STRONG SUMMIT AGRICULTURE STATEMENT
TOPICS:
	
PLACES:

CONTENT:
	The United States will push for a
	strong statement from Western heads-of-state at the June
	economic summit in Venice, urging "comprehensive" negotiations
	on agriculture begin immediately to reduce domestic farm
	subsidies, the senior U.S. planner for the summit said.
	    "Agriculture has really become the number one international
	economic problem," Allen Wallis, undersecretary of state for
	economic affairs, told Reuters in an interview.
	    At the Tokyo economic summit last year, western leaders
	identified agriculture as a major international problem but
	made no specific recommendations. This year, Wallis said the
	U.S. will press for a statement instructing trade ministers to
	begin negotiating on the issue, and include domestic programs.
	    While the Western leaders, including president Reagan, will
	not conduct specific negotiations, Wallis said they can give a
	push to the agriculture talks under the General Agreement on
	Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
	    Wallis said the leaders should endorse a "comprehensive"
	negotiation, which is interpreted as including domestic
	policies as well as import restraints and export subsidies.
	    "They (GATT talks) really have to deal with domestic
	policies, as well as trade arrangements," Wallis said.
	    Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter has said a summit
	statement of support for agriculture talks is part of an
	overall U.S. strategy to build momentum for the GATT farm
	talks.
	    Public statements in recent weeks by several members of the
	Reagan cabinet have stressed the agriculture issue.
	    Yeutter and Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng will
	repeatedly discuss agriculture during a visit to Japan starting
	next week. Yeutter said agriculture will also be on the agenda
	of the trade ministers "quadrilateral" talks among
	Japan, the European Community, the U.S. and Canada this month.
	    And the ministerial meeting of the Paris-based Organization
	for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, in May will
	highlight the agriculture problem, Yeutter said.
	    The OECD in May is expected to release a study of domestic
	farm subsidies which shows that Japan has the highest subsidies
	among industrial countries, but aid to farmers is also generous
	in the EC and United States.
	    The controversial OECD study calculated a measure of farm
	subsidies called the Producer Subsidy Equivalent, PSE, which
	allows farm aid to be compared across countries.
	    Some officials including British Agriculture Minister
	Michael Jopling, have said the PSE could be useful as a method
	of negotiating lower domestic farm subsidies worldwide.
	    However, the State Department's Wallis said while the PSE
	can be useful in negotiations, it has shortcomings and "its not
	definitive."
	    He and other U.S. officials said the Reagan administration
	has not yet reached a decision on a specific U.S. agriculture
	proposal to present to the GATT.
	    "I would expect it (U.S. proposal) to be in the fall,"
	after the series of international meetings, Wallis said.
	    At preliminary meetings of the GATT agriculture committee,
	the United States has pushed for the so-called "freeze and
	rollback" approach. Subsidies would first be frozen at current
	levels, then rolled-back jointly in stages.
	    However, the Reagan administration perplexed some trade
	analysts recently by reacting cooly to a plan by Australian
	prime minister Bob Hawke calling for a similar approach. Hawke
	unveiled a seven-point plan to freeze and subsequently reduce
	the gap between high farm price supports and world prices.
	    Australia is leading a the so-called Cairns group of 13
	coutries pressing for freer agriculture trade.
	    "The proposals that the so-called Cairns group are coming
	up with seem to be focusing on short-run, quick fixes which is
	not what we think is what's called for here," Wallis said.
	    Wallis and other said the U.S. wants a "long-range"
	solution to the agriculture problem.
	    U.S. officials also have criticized the Australian proposal
	because they said it deals primarily with the difference
	between domestic prices and world levels in the EC and U.S.,
	but fails to focus on the question of market access.
	    At the same time the U.S. is rejecting the Australian
	"quick fix", Wallis said the U.S. will press at the summit for
	a declaration urging that agriculture talks be completed
	"expeditiously", or within two years.
	    The unstated U.S. strategy, U.S. officials said, is to keep
	the pressure on the EC this year through the export enhancement
	program and lower value of the dollar, in the hope that a
	sweeping agriculture agreement is possible in 1988.

	GERMAN GROWTH WILL NOT CUT U.S. DEFICIT -BANGEMANN
TOPICS:

PLACES:

CONTENT:
	Economics Minister Martin Bangemann, who
	flies to Washington this weekend for high level talks, said
	boosting West German economic growth would not have any
	significant effect on the high U.S. Current account deficit.
	    In a paper prepared ahead of his trip, Bangemann said
	Bonn's trading partners had been asking whether West German
	growth was slowing and whether the Federal Republic should not
	in the future pursue more strongly expansionary policies.
	    In the paper Bangemann wrote, "It is not possible to reduce
	the U.S. Current account deficit by any signficant amount just
	through more stimulation of the West German economy."
	    One U.S. Administration policy maker said in Washington
	this week that the United States government wanted West Germany
	and Japan to reduce their interest rates even further to
	stimulate their economies.
	    Bangemann said it was clear the high mark, as well as
	uncertainty about further currency developments, was making
	companies here cautious about production plans and investments.
	    While West Germany did not seek exchange rates which
	unilaterally favoured its exports, it favoured more stability
	and realistic rates, which corresponded to "fundamentals."
	    He welcomed the February "Louvre Agreement" of six industrial
	nations to stabilise currencies and said, "(We) expect all
	parties to hold by the accords struck there." West Germany had
	fulfilled its pledge of boosting planned tax cuts, he noted.
	    Despite calls for lower interest rates, Bundesbank
	Vice-President Helmut Schlesinger has hinted that central bank
	policy may even have to be tightened.
	    He wrote in a newspaper article published yesterday that
	the Bundesbank's current accommodative stance could not
	continue in the long term.
	    During his trip to Washington, which runs from April 26 to
	29, Bangemann will meet Secretary of State George Shultz, trade
	envoy Clayton Yeutter, World Bank President Barber Conable, IMF
	Managing Director Michel Camdessus and Paul Volcker, Chairman
	of the Federal Reserve Board.

	U.S. HOUSE PANEL TAKES FIRST TRADE BILL VOTES

CONTENT:
	House trade lawmakers took their
	first votes on measures designed to toughen U.S. trade laws but
	held over until tomorrow the most difficult votes on
	controversial plans to protect American industries.
	    Meeting in closed session, the House Ways and Means Trade
	Subcommittee failed to resolve one of the most sensitive issues
	in the bill--whether they will force major foreign trading
	partners to severely cut their trade surpluses with the United
	States.
	    The subcommittee is considering a toned-down version of
	Democratic-sponsored trade legislation that aims to open
	foreign markets but which drops last year's effort to force
	President Reagan to retaliate with quotas or tariffs.
	    Congressional aides who asked not to be identified said the
	lawmakers intend to wrap up their proposals tomorrow and will
	consider a proposal to mandate retaliation without setting
	specific trade penalties.
	    The legislation faces another hurdle in the full Ways and
	Means Committee next week before the full House votes on it.
	    Rep. Richard Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat who is seeking
	his party's 1988 presidential nomination, said he may offer an
	amendment to call for reductions in the trade surpluses of
	those countries with barriers to imports of U.S. goods.
	    This would be a moderated version of his earlier plan to
	force a mandatory ten per cent annual cut in the trade surplus
	with the United States by Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, West
	Germany and other countries with the largest trade imbalances.
	    "My criteria for a good amendment sets a standard for
	getting the trade deficit down," he told reporters.
	    The trade law changes are to become part of a major
	congressional and administration effort to turn around the
	record U.S. trade deficit of 169 billion dlrs last year by
	opening up foreign markets and making U.S. products more
	competitive.
	    House Speaker James Wright, a Texas Democrat, said again
	today he expects the full House will approve the trade bill by
	May and that Reagan will accept the final congressional bill.
	    "I expect whatever is reported (by the Ways and Means
	Committee) will pass. We will have a good bill and an effective
	bill," he told reporters.
	    The comprehensive trade bill will include work by other
	committees to ease export controls on high technology, to aid
	U.S. workers displaced by foreign competition, to stimulate
	research and development, to remove foreign trade barriers and
	to improve education and worker training.
	    The lawmakers agreed that for the first time a U.S.
	industry could charge foreign producers with unfair competition
	if they deny basic worker rights such as collective bargaining,
	safety rules and payment of a minimum wage appropriate to the
	country's economic development.
	    They transferred to U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
	Yeutter the powers now held by Reagan to decide whether to
	retaliate against foreign violations of fair trade rules and
	whether an injured industry deserves import relief.
	    They agreed to make it easier for a company to get
	temporary relief from import competition but agreed the
	industry should provide a plan to become competitive.
	    The administration has not announced its support but
	Yeutter said yesterday, "I am cautiously optimistic," that the
	Democratic-led House will come up with an acceptable bill.

CONTENT:
	U.S. trade representative Clayton
	Yeutter today said that if the European Community's Council of
	Ministers approves a tax on vegetable oils and fats, another
	major transatlantic trade row will erupt over agriculture.
	    In a statement issued by the trade representative's office
	following a speech to the American Soybean Association's board
	of directors, Yeutter said the proposed tax would have a severe
	impact on American soybean farmers, who export some 2.4 billion
	dlrs in soybeans and products annually to the EC.
	    "This is an unacceptable situation for us and its
	(vegetable oils tax) enactment would leave us no choice but to
	vigorously protect our trade rights and defend our access to
	the European market," Yeutter said.
	    Yeutter said the proposed vegetable oils tax would violate
	EC obligations under the GATT.
	    He said the effect of the tax would be to double the price
	of soyoil produced from imported soybeans, making margarine
	made from soyoil more expensive than tallow-based margarine,
	and closer in price to expensive European butter.
	    "I am astonished that the EC commission would propose such
	a provocative measure so soon after we successfully resolved
	the agricultural dispute over the enlargement of the EC to
	include Spain and Portugal," Yeutter said.
	    "It serves no purpose to embark on another confrontational
	course before the recent wounds have healed and as we are
	beginning to make progress on the Uruaguay round (of global
	trade talks)," he said.

	    Trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues at a

	progress had been made in preparing for the negotiations which
	must not be sidetracked.
	    "We live in troubled and dangerous times for the world

	    "We have seen that the failure of the world trading system

	    He added: "The cost of failure is beyond calculation. It is
	our last hope and best opportunity this century. We will not

	    The ministers are in New Zealand to review world trade
	since the "Uruguay round" talks last Sepember. The meeting is
	also part of preparations for a full-scale conference of the
	General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Venice in

	    The Uruguay meeting is considered by most countries to have

	    Another was to seek ways of popularising freer trade to
	people who felt the pain of readjustment but could not see the
	benefits, as well as preventing "bush fires of confrontation
	while we proceed with orderly negotiations."
	    The meeting is being attended by 25 overseas delegations
	including representatives of GATT and the Economic Community.
	    The delegates include U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
	Yeutter.
	    American sources say he is ready to state that the best way

	implement four key Uruguay proposals:
	    -- an end to agricultural subsidies;
	    -- inclusion of trade in services and investments in GATT
	regulations;
	    -- tightening of restrictions on pirating of so-called
	intellectual property such as trademarks, patents and
	copyrights;
	    -- new rules to resolve trade disputes among GATT's 92
	member states.
	    Earlier, New Zealand sources had said French Foreign Trade

	while we proceed with orderly negotiations."
	    The meeting is being attended by 25 overseas delegations
	including representatives of GATT and the Economic Community.
	    The delegates include U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
	Yeutter.
	    American sources say he is ready to state that the best way
	to reverse protectionist sentiment in the United States is to
	implement four key Uruguay proposals:
	    -- an end to agricultural subsidies;
	    -- inclusion of trade in services and investments in GATT
	regulations;
	    -- tightening of restrictions on pirating of so-called
	intellectual property such as trademarks, patents and
	copyrights;
	    -- new rules to resolve trade disputes among GATT's 92
	member states.
	    Earlier, New Zealand sources had said French Foreign Trade
	Minister Michel Noir had pulled out of the informal GATT talks
	for domestic political reasons.
	    Cabinet chief Bernard Prauge will lead the French
	delegation.
