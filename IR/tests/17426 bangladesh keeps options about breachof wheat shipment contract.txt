	BANGLADESH KEEPS OPTIONS OPEN ON GRAIN PENALTY
TOPICS:
	grain, wheat
PLACES:
	bangladesh
CONTENT:
	Bangladesh is keeping its options open on
	whether to seek a penalty from Continental Grain Co of the
	United States for alleged breach of a wheat shipment contract,
	but is also asking the company to expedite shipment of the
	cargo, a senior Food Ministry official said.
	    The official, who declined to be named, said the company
	under a deal agreed to ship 100,000 tonnes of wheat by April 7
	and another 100,000 tonnes by April 16. But it shipped only
	126,000 tonnes altogether.
	    The supplier will have to pay penalty at a rate of two dlrs
	per tonne for every delayed day according to a document signed
	by both the Food Ministry and the suppliers' agent in Dhaka, he
	told Reuters.
	    "If they arrange quick shipment, we may take a lenient view,"
	the official said. The issue is expected to be decided at a
	cabinet meeting scheduled for next Sunday, he added.
	    A pro-government Bengali daily "Dainik Janata" reported today
	that Continental Grain could face a penalty of 200 mln taka
	(6.49 mln dlrs) for alleged failure to maintain shipment
	schedule.
	    The local agent of Continental Grain, Shafi Ahmed
	Choudhury, told Reuters he applied to the Bangladesh government
	for an extension of the shipment period because loading of
	wheat at London was being delayed due to bad weather and a
	faulty elevator at a grain silo. But the government has not yet
	granted the extension, he said.
	    Choudhury said the freight rate and price of wheat had gone
	up after the deal was signed, which resulted in a financial
	loss to the company.
	    He said he was not "officially informed" of the move to
	impose a penalty, although he was "not totally unaware of it."
	    Continental Grain officials in New York declined to
	comment.

	NO POLICY FOR OR AGAINST CERTIFICATES -- OMB
TOPICS:
	
PLACES:
	usa
CONTENT:
	The U.S. Office of Management and
	Budget does not have a policy position one way or another on
	whether the Agriculture Department's commodity certificate
	program should be expanded or contracted, an OMB official said.
	    Speaking at the National Grain and Feed Association's
	annual convention, Ron Landis, chief of OMB's agricultural
	branch, said instead of an across the board policy for or
	against certificates, OMB has worked and will continue to work
	very closely with USDA in determining how many certificates
	should be sent out in each government farm payment.
	    "Recent evidence by the General Accounting Office and the
	Congressional Budget Office suggest that certificates can and
	do increase budget exposure," Landis said.
	    But Landis also noted that certificates have numerous
	beneficial impacts.
	    These benefits are helping maintain U.S. price
	competitiveness, freeing up storage space and saving the
	government storage and handling costs.
	    The major drawback to certificates, said Landis, is that
	they increase budget exposure relative to cash through use of
	the pik and roll marketing strategy.
	    In the pik and roll strategy, a farmer puts his grain under
	loan, redeems it with certificates, then keeps the difference
	between the price he paid for certificates and the county loan
	rate.
	    However, if the benefits of certificates outweigh the added
	costs, OMB officials said they will support continuation of the
	program.
	    "OMB says certificates have a very positive effect on the
	market, but the question is do those positive benefits outweigh
	the added costs. If they do, then the certificate program is
	good," an OMB official told Reuters.
	    Landis calculated that the redemption of each certificate
	worth 1,500 bushels results in 176 dlrs in storage savings for
	wheat farmers, 270 dlrs for corn farmers and 92 dlrs for
	soybean farmers. The pik and roll strategy represents a benefit
	of about 35 cents per bushel per farmer, he said.
	    But Landis also noted that recent studies by CBO suggest
	that an additional one billion dlrs of certificates released to
	the market could result in outlays of 1.15 dlrs in cash for
	every dlr released in certificates.
	    OMB is concerned that too many certificates released onto
	the market could cause prices to drop too low and government
	costs to increase too much.
	    But Landis said OMB has not determined what amount of
	certificates would be excessive.

	MOST JAPAN FIRMS NOT RENEWING IRAN TERM CONTRACTS
TOPICS:
	crude
PLACES:
	japan, iran
CONTENT:
	Most Japanese companies have decided not
	to renew term contracts to lift Iranian crude oil because spot
	prices remain considerably lower than OPEC's official levels,
	industry sources said.
	    They said a cargo of the Mideast benchmark crude Dubai
	traded yesterday at 16.50 dlrs a barrel, compared to its
	official price of 17.42 dlrs.
	    Only one Japanese company has renewed its term contract for
	Iranian crude oil for the second quarter, the sources said.
	    The sources said Japanese companies had been lifting a
	total of about 185,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Iranian crude
	under term contracts, but only one firm has agreed to lift in
	the second quarter. It is lifting just 10,000 to 15,000 bpd.
	    They said this move could inspire Iran to offer discounts
	on cargoes loading in April, but the likelihood of discounts
	depended largely on the levels of spot prices.
	    "If the spot price of Dubai goes above 17.30 dlrs we would
	probably buy Iranian crude at the official price," one Japanese
	refiner said.
	    "We don't intend to put pressure on them," he added.
	    Buyers have little incentive to renew contracts to lift oil
	at official OPEC prices while spot prices on all grades are
	considerably lower, oil traders said.
	    They said if spot prices move higher there will be no
	problem finding OPEC crude to purchase at the official prices.
	Qatar has chartered floating storage for its crude oil after
	finding no buyers at official prices in March. The problem is
	likely to recur in April, adding to that country's surplus.
	    The traders added that Iraq had dissociated itself from
	OPEC's December production agreement, while agreeing to the
	fixed prices.
	    But oil analysts said if OPEC keeps group output close to
	its first-half 1987 ceiling of 15.8 mln bpd, supply and demand
	would be balanced by the end of the second quarter.
	    They also said if OPEC holds its official price structure
	based on a reference price of 18 dlrs, spot price fluctuations
	should be limited to a 16.50 to 17.20 dlrs range for Dubai and
	a 17 to 18 dlrs range for the North Sea's Brent blend.
	    One Japanese refiner said, "At the moment there's a lot of
	pressure on OPEC, particularly on Qatar. But if they hold out
	there will be no problem, and I'm beginning to trust their
	ability."
	    Nigerian oil minister and OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman
	told a news conference in Lagos yesterday, "Nigeria and all
	member countries of OPEC remain determined to uphold the
	December agreement by adhering strictly to their various quotas
	and official selling prices."
	    He said OPEC believed consumers had drawn heavily on stocks
	of both crude oil and refined products, reducing them to levels
	well below this time last year. He said consumers would soon
	return to the market in search of crude.
	    A Japanese refiner said, "The European and U.S. Markets are
	beginning to look better so OPEC might be quite lucky."

	AMR (AMR) TO START INFORMATION CAMPAIGN IN DISPUTE
TOPICS:

	AMR Corp's American Airlines will start
	its own information campaign in its dispute with the
	Association of Professional Flight Attendants.
	    The company, which has been negotiating with its 10,000
	attendants since late last year, will give out information
	brochures at its terminals, outlining its position, according
	to L.C. Duncan Jr., vice president of corporate communications.
	    During a news conference, Duncan said the APFA was
	conducting a "smear campaign" by handing out leaflets at the
	company's terminals. The union says it was trying to win public
	support by presenting its position.
	     Last month, American fired 20 flight attendants for
	handing out the leaflets at Dallas-Fort Worth Airport. The
	union is fighting the move in court.
	     In response to a question, Duncan said the company's
	latest proposal for a new three-year contract, which was
	offered March 11, does away with a two-tiered system of pay,
	whereby new employees are paid on a lower scale than those
	hired before 1983.
	     However, the union has contended that the company's
	proposal keeps the system in a disguised form.
	     A union spoksewoman had no immediate response to
	American's announcement.
	     Currently, the airline and the union are in the middle of
	a federally-mandated 30-day cooling off period that was
	triggered after both sides rejected a federal mediator's offer
	of binding arbitration.
	     When the period ends on April 25, the union is free to
	strike and the company is free to unilaterally impose its
	latest offer under the Federal Railway Labor Act.
	     Even though the union has repeatedly said it will not
	strike, Duncan confirmed today that the company has received
	permission from the Federal Aviation Administration to speed up
	the hiring of new attendants.
	     In response to a question, Duncan denied the company was
	thinking of firing attendants who do not comply after the 25th.
	     "It (the speeded-up hiring) is a precautionary measure,"
	he said.

	Dome Petroleum Ltd's revised debt
	restructuring plan keeps the company alive and improves its
	appeal as a takeover target, but full debt repayment depends on
	a sharp oil price rise, oil and banking analysts said.
	    Dome's complex proposal to let creditors link some or all
	of their debt to oil-indexed debentures or convert it to equity
	is "very cut and dried and to the point," Peters and Co Ltd
	Calgary-based energy analyst Wilf Gobert said.
	    Dome "is saying, This is the way it is. There isn't enough
	money to pay you back,'" he added.
	    The plan "strikes me as a very pragmatic thing to do,"
	First Marathon Securities Ltd oil analyst Jim Doak commented.
	    He said the plan seeks to formally tie payments to
	creditors with the price of oil, which governs Dome's cash flow
	and ability to service its debt.
	    Dome expects its total debt to reach 6.4 billion Canadian
	dlrs by June 30, 1987, when an interim debt rescheduling plan
	expires and Dome hopes to implement the long term plan.
	    Gobert said the plan would rank secured and unsecured
	creditors in a complex series of repayment categories or "an
	agreed pecking order of what your (creditors) claim to assets
	is."
	    Potential suitors would find Dome easier to swallow under
	the debt restructuring plan because it proposes to resolve
	competing claims on assets pledged to secured creditors and on
	remaining unpledged assets, Gobert and others said.
	    "Certainly the restructuring plan, once it's agreed to and
	put in place, is going to make it easier for someone to come in
	and look at doing a deal on it (acquiring the company)," Gobert
	remarked.
	    "It's going to be a lot easier than it is right now because
	you'll have settled the pecking order question," he added.
	    Gobert believes the debt plan may be partly motivated by a
	desire to sell Dome Petroleum as a whole.
	    "If the creditors wanted to liquidate their bank loans they
	could do it in an orderly fashion through the sale of the
	company, as opposed to dismemberment," he said.
	    Dome's proposal includes rescheduling secured debt payments
	over a 15 to 20 year schedule, linking payments to cash flows
	generated by assets pledged against loans and establishing
	interest rates that allow for changing oil prices.
	    Creditors' only real alternative to Dome's plan is "an
	asset grab which would liquidate the company at distress
	prices, and the banks would spend the next 20 years in court
	deciding who had what asset," First Marathon's Doak said.
	    For Dome's creditors, the plan does not offer a quick
	method to recover loans, but extends payment time in the hope
	that oil prices will rise, increasing the amount of the
	company's debt payments, Merrill Lynch Canada Inc bank analyst
	Terry Shaunessy said.
	    The plan "is not a solution. It says give me more time and
	let's keep our fingers crossed that oil goes way up."
	    Doak and Shaunessy estimated oil prices would have to rise
	to about 28 to 30 U.S. dlrs a barrel to fully service all of
	the company's debt.
	    Analysts said the plan would ensure the company continues
	to operate, but provides little other benefit to common
	shareholders.
	    "From a common shareholder standpoint, all this does is
	sort of keep him on the life support system, because there
	isn't any equity unless you get a big increase in oil prices,"
	Gobert remarked.
	    Analysts said Dome's common shares, trading today at 1.12
	dlrs, off four cents, on the Toronto Stock Exchange,
	essentially represent a long term warrant pegged to oil prices.
	    "You have to be looking at an extremely high price of oil
	in the context of historical trends before there's any residual
	value for the common shareholders," analyst Doak said.
	    While Dome's plan said lenders will be able to convert debt
	to common shares, the amount of dilution depends on share
	conversion prices still to be negotiated and how much lenders
	would choose to convert, the company said.

	ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - DUTCH EXCHANGE RATE POLICY
TOPICS:
	money-fx, dfl
PLACES:
	netherlands, west-germany
CONTENT:
	Recent slackness on Dutch capital
	markets has led some bankers to question the Central Bank's
	policy of pegging the guilder firmly to the West German mark
	and to ask for more flexiblility in exchange rate policy.
	    While agreeing with the Bank's commitment to defend the
	guilder strongly, some bankers want the Bank to make more use
	of the range within which the guilder and the mark can
	fluctuate against each other in the European Monetary System
	(EMS).
	    Roelof Nelissen, chairman of Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank NV
	(Amro) said the Central Bank's policy was overcautious.
	    "I would like to suggest that the Bank use more freely the
	range given to the guilder in the EMS," Nelissen said at the
	presentation of Amro's 1986 annual report last week.
	    Within the EMS, the mark is allowed to fluctuate against
	the guilder between 110.1675 and 115.235 guilders per 100.
	    The Central Bank maintains a stricter policy and tries to
	keep the mark below the 113.00 guilders per 100. It regards a
	stable exchange rate as its main target, using interest rate
	policies to influence the exchange rate.
	    The preference of exchange rate goals above interest rate
	aims goes almost undisputed in the Netherlands.
	    Critics say the Bank keeps the reins unnecessarily short.
	    Rabobank Nederland said in its latest economic bulletin: "By
	maintaining the 113.00 limit, the Central Bank raises the
	expectation it will always intervene above that level. If it
	suddenly needs more flexibility it will find it very hard to
	obtain."
	    Amro's Nelissen said relatively small changes in interest
	rates and exchange rates could cause substantial flows of
	securities business and sharp fluctuations on the Dutch capital
	market. Large interest rate changes were often needed to bring
	about small changes in the guilder/mark exchange rate, he
	added.
	    Unlike Amro, Algemene Bank Nederland NV (ABN) says this is
	a price the Dutch have to pay. It fully agrees with the Central
	Bank's policy, director-general Julien Geertsema told Reuters,
	noting a 1983 decision not to revalue the guilder fully with
	the mark in the EMS hurt confidence in the Dutch currency.
	    "It is a pity we need such a wide interest rate difference
	between West Germany to maintain the exchange rate," he added.
	    Interest rate differentials between West Germany and the
	Netherlands are the main factors that trigger capital flows
	between the two countries, as the economic performance of the
	two does not differ much, economists said.
	    Data on 1986 capital flows between West Germany and the
	Netherlands have not yet been released, but in 1985 they
	accounted for only 10 pct of total trade flows between the two
	countries, put at 110 billion guilders for 1986 by the
	Dutch-German Chamber of Commerce earlier this month.
	    Economists say capital flows are more sensitive to interest
	and exchange rates.
	    West Germany is the Netherlands' largest single trading
	partner, taking 28 pct of Dutch exports and providing 26 pct of
	imports in the last quarter of 1986, Central Bureau of
	Statistics figures show.
	    At the moment, the rates for three month euromark deposits
	trade around 4.0 pct while the same deposits in guilders have a
	rate of around 5-7/16 pct.
	    Amro bank argues that the Dutch real interest rate will
	even rise further because of expectations of deflation here in
	1987, contrasting with slight inflation in West Germany.
	    In the Netherlands, the cost of living is expected to
	decrease by 1.5 pct at a GNP growth rate of two pct, the Dutch
	Central Planning Agency said in its 1987 forecast last month.
	German GNP is seen rising by two to 2.5 pct, but with inflation
	between zero and 1.0 pct, according to most German forecasts.
	    But despite this upward push on real Dutch rates, money
	dealers do not expect the Central Bank to cut official rates
	independently without prior moves by the Bundesbank.
	    Following the West German interest rate cuts on January 22,
	the Dutch Central Bank did not lower its rates but set a 0.5
	pct lower tariff for special advances and abandoned its credit
	surcharge. Most traders were surprised by this move as they had
	expected the Bank to follow suit unconditionally, they said.
	    The Bank said it lowered the rate with the largest impact
	on the money market as far as the exchange rate permitted.
	    While not entirely unsympathetic to critics of its
	policies, the Central Bank keeps its grip firm and the range
	narrow.
	    "The European Monetary System is not only a relationship
	between the guilder and the mark. Many times widening of the
	margin between the two would implicate we have to buy or sell
	large amounts of a third currency," Central Bank vice-director
	Jan-Hendrik Du Marchie Sarvaas said.
	    "If we allowed the guilder to become a little cheaper, the
	markets would start to believe it was weak. We don't want that.
	We want to make clear that the guilder is just as strong as the
	mark," he said.

	COMMODITY PACTS MORE ORIENTED TOWARDS MARKET
TOPICS:

CONTENT:
	Consuming countries, chastened by the
	collapse of International Tin Council (ITC) price support
	operations in 1985, are insisting more than ever before that
	commodity pacts reflect the reality of the markets they are
	serving, a Reuter survey showed.
	    They want price ranges to be more responsive to market
	trends - to avoid overstimulating output and straining the
	accords' support operations - and intervention rules that avoid
	the risk of exports by non-members undermining the pacts.
	Consumers and producers, mindful of ITC buffer stock losses,
	have also sought strict conditions for buffer operations.
	    Importers and some key exporting countries have shunned a
	generalised approach to commodity price stabilisation and
	prefer to assess each commodity case by case, the survey
	showed.
	    The International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) last week set
	precise limits on what the Buffer Stock Manager (BSM) could do
	under the new agreement. It imposed daily and weekly purchase
	limits, prohibited the BSM from operating on futures markets
	and stipulated, after consumer insistence, that up to 15 pct of
	total buffer stock purchases could be of non-member cocoa. This
	will help prevent lower quality cocoa from Malaysia, the
	world's fourth largest producer, undermining the market.
	    The cocoa pact establishes precise differentials the Buffer
	Stock Manager must use when purchasing varying grades.
	    A new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA) was
	adopted earlier this month in Geneva. Importing and exporting
	countries agreed several changes to make the reference price
	more responsive to market trends and they eliminated provisions
	under which the buffer stock could borrow from banks to finance
	operations. Direct cash contributions from members will fund
	buffer stock purchases. Bank financing was a particular feature
	of the failed ITC buffer stock which suffered losses running
	into hundreds of millions of sterling. Legal wrangles continue.
	    Recent International Coffee Organization (ICO) negotiations
	in London exemplified the degree to which consumers insist that
	agreements reflect market reality, commodity analysts said.
	    Consumers and a small group of producers argued that
	"objective criteria" should be used to define export quota
	shares, which would have meant a reduction in the share of
	Brazil, the world's leading producer. Brazil wanted to maintain
	its previous quota share of 30 pct. The talks broke down and,
	although an ICO executive board meeting starts in London today,
	delegates and trade sources see chances of any near term
	negotiations on export quota distribution as remote.
	    International agreements exist for sugar and wheat. These
	do not have any economic clauses but provide a forum for
	discussions on possible future economic agreements, collect
	statistics and draw up market analyses. Analysts said
	differences between sugar exporting countries have held up any
	progress towards an accord with economic teeth, while sheer
	competition between major exporters amid a world grain glut
	militate against any pact with economic provisions for wheat.
	    An alternative focus for commodity discussions are
	international study groups, made up of governments with advice
	from industry, such as those for lead and zinc and rubber.
	    The U.N. Common fund for commodities, with a planned
	directly contributed capital of 470 mln dlrs, has failed to
	become operational because neither the U.S. Nor the Soviet
	Union has ratified it. U.S. Officials in Washington said the
	U.S. Doubts the fund would be able to fulfil its objectives,
	citing the lack of widespread support.
	    U.S. Officials in Washington and Malaysian officials in
	Kuala Lumpur expressed a policy of looking at each commodity
	pact case by case. U.S. Officials said it has been willing to
	study individual cases for economically sound, market-oriented
	commodity accords balancing producer and consumer interests.
	    "We see little to be gained by attempting to increase the
	price of a commodity whose long-term trend is downward,"
	official Administration policy states. The U.S. Currently
	belongs to only two international commodity agreements that
	have economic clauses - the International Coffee Agreement
	(ICA) and INRA - but it is also a member of the sugar and wheat
	pacts.
	    The U.S. Did not join the International Cocoa Agreement
	because it considered its proposed price ranges unrealistic and
	not designed to protect the interests of consuming countries,
	the State Department said. U.S. Officials singled out the INRA
	as the one commodity agreement that seems to be working.
	    U.S. Negotiators were successful in getting other members
	of the pact to agree that the price review and adjustment
	mechanism of the rubber agreement would accurately reflect
	market trends and also to continue the accord as a market
	oriented agreement, U.S. Officials said.
	    Canadian officials in Ottawa also said they have
	consistently tried to look at membership of commodity pacts on
	the merits of each case. Malaysian Primary Industries Minister
	Lim Keng Yaik told Reuters in Kuala Lumpur his country, the
	world's top producer of rubber, tin and palm oil, decides its
	participation in international commodity pacts case by case.
	    Malaysia is a member of the Association of Tin Producing
	Countries (ATPC) which produce 65 pct of world tin. The ATPC
	launched a plan to limit member tin exports to 96,000 tonnes
	for a year from March to cut the tin surplus to 50,000 from
	70,000.
	    Economist in the West German Ministry of Agriculture and
	delegate to cocoa, wheat and sugar agreements Peter Baron told
	Reuters in London, "Agreements with economic clauses to
	stabilise prices could function if fixed price ranges were
	close to market reality, if there was full participation by
	producers and consumers, and if participants were prepared to
	take their obligations in the framework of the agreement
	seriously."
	    But Baron added, "No real sanctions are available for a
	country that doesn't stick to its obligations...The German
	approach is sceptical. We don't think agreements are the best
	instrument to help developing countries. They were never meant
	to be a vehicle for the transfer of resources and that is how
	developing countries often interpret them."
	    Traditionally Britain has always been supportive of
	commodity agreements, reflecting its strong links with Third
	World producing countries. But recently demands for more
	stringent and justifiable pacts with emphasis placed on the
	need for "intellectual honesty" and "objective criteria" have
	grown.
	    British officials stress the need for commodity pacts to be
	a two way partnership in trade rather than a disguise for aid.
	    It is now seen as essential that any pacts involving direct
	market participation through a buffer stock have a high degree
	of transparency and do not contain the risk of open-ended
	borrowing that occurred in the tin pact, they said. U.K.
	Delegates talk of stabilisation and the need for prices to
	reflect changes in market structure and price trends rather
	than dictate what prices should be.
	    A Foreign Ministry official in Tokyo said Japan urges price
	realism in commodity pacts, adding high prices inflate supply.
	    A government spokesman in Paris said France is favourable
	to commodity pacts. France, a large consumer and producer of
	sugar, favours a sugar pact as long as it reflects the real
	market situation, particularly regarding stocks.
	    Indonesia's Foreign Minister Mochtar Kusumaatmadja told
	Reuters in Jakarta: "These agreements can work as long as the
	problems are cyclical..But it's another matter when there are
	structural problems..But we are still committed to commodity
	agreements as an act of faith." Nicaraguan External Trade
	Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca said in London producers
	cannot afford not to give their backing to commodity
	agreements.
	    "The political will is not there on the part of some
	consumers to make agreements work," Martinez Cuenca said.
	    The head of the economics department in the Brazilian
	Foreign Ministry, Sebastiao do Rego Barros, told Reuters an
	agreement can be successful if it keeps a link with market
	reality. If you have an agreement such as coffee with a system
	of quotas, with a link between prices practised inside the pact
	and actual market prices, it can work. UNCTAD spokesman Graham
	Shanley said consuming countries realise steady export earnings
	enhance developing countries' ability to service debt and mean
	greater demand for industrialised nations' capital goods.

	OPPOSITION LEADER WARNS OF FAMINE IN BANGLADESH

CONTENT:
	The failure of the Bangladesh government
	to tackle the country's current food crisis could lead to a
	famine, the leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, Khaleda
	Zia, told a press conference yesterday.
	    Prices of rice rose by at least 25 pct across the country
	in March and the government has begun emergency rice and wheat
	sales to lower cereal prices, a food ministry report said.
	    Ministry officials said the next harvest, due in mid-April
	will ease the situation. "Temporary grain shortage in the arid
	north and some other rain-starved regions is not unusual at
	this time of the year," one official said.
	    Khaleda, said corrupt practices by food officials and
	failure to procure enough grains contributed to the crisis. Her
	remarks coincided with newspaper reports that a continuing heat
	wave has destroyed thousands of acres of crops in the
	south-west.
	    Officials said last week Bangladesh now has only 390,000
	tonnes of grain in stock which would be exhausted in two or
	three weeks. Bangladesh expects to produce 14.5 mln tonnes of
	rice and 1.5 mln tonnes of wheat in 1986/87 ending June 30. It
	revised its food import target for this fiscal year upward by
	300,000 tonnes to 1.8 mln.

	U.K., AUSTRALIA OFFER WHEAT TO BANGLADESH
TOPICS:

CONTENT:
	Britain and Australia have offered a
	total of 129,250 tonnes of wheat to Bangladesh as grants to
	contain rising cereal prices and help support rural employment
	projects, officials said.
	    They said 79,250 tonnes of wheat promised by Britain would
	be shipped next week and used for the government's "Food for
	Work" program in the villages.
	    Under the program, workers building roads, digging
	irrigation canals and engaged in other rural development
	activities get their daily wages in wheat instead of money.
	    The 50,000 tonnes of Australian wheat would arrive in
	Bangladesh next month and be sold under open-market operations
	designed to stop price increases, the officials said.
	    Prices of rice and wheat have risen at least 15 pct in the
	past month, market sources said. But the government expects
	prices to fall after the wheat harvest next month.
