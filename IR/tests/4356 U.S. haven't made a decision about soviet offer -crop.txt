	U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard
	Lyng said the Reagan administration had not decided on offering
	the Soviet Union subsidized wheat but that such an offer had
	not been ruled out.
	    In an interview with Reuters, Lyng also said that he had no
	knowledge of any upcoming discussion of the matter within the

	    Asked if the administration had ruled out offering to
	subsidize wheat exports to the Soviet Union under the
	department's export enhancement program, Lyng said, "No. We
	haven't made a decision on it, haven't even talked about it,
	haven't even looked at it."
	    Reminded that there have been reports that Moscow would buy
	U.S. wheat if competitively priced, Lyng responded, "If they
	(the Soviets) would offer to buy some wheat, would we accept
	it? It would depend on what price they offered."
	    Lyng added that he did not think the price of U.S. wheat
	was far off the world price.
	    Asked about persistent speculation that the administration
	would offer Moscow a wheat subsidy, Lyng said, "Some people
	think they're doing it to see if they can get a little spurt in
	the market."
	    Agriculture Undersecretary Daniel Amstutz last week asked
	the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to investigate reports
	that wheat prices were being manipulated by reports that a U.S.
	wheat subsidy offer was imminent.

	NO PRESSING NEED FOR SOVIET WHEAT SUBSIDY - LYNG

	The Soviets have not indicated an
	urgent need for a U.S. wheat subsidy offer, and it is unlikely
	that such an offer will be ma during the U.S./Soviet summit
	expected to be held next month, Agriculture Secretary Richard
	Lyng told Reuters.
	    In an exclusive interview with Reuters, Lyng said he did
	not know if the United States will offer Moscow another wheat
	subsidy offer this year or when that offer will be made.
	    "Last year it was well into the year before we offered it.
	There's been nothing that's taken place to indicate to me that
	there's a pressing need on their part for that sort of deal (a
	wheat subsidy)."
	    When asked if a subsidy would be offered at a U.S./Soviet
	summit, Lyng said, "No, I don't think so. I don't think that."
	    The Agriculture Secretary said a U.S. wheat subsidy deal to
	Moscow would not be the kind of topic appropriate for
	discussion at a summit.
	    "It would not be the kind of issue that the President or the
	Chairman would get into specific negotiations or discussions
	about," Lyng said.
	    "When Mr. Nikonov (communist party secretary for
	agriculture) was here ... he indicated that trade in wheat was
	not something that would be discussed with the President of the
	United States. He said it's not presidential," Lyng said.
	    Lyng said uncertainties about wheat quality in some major
	producing areas of the world, volatile wheat prices and the
	still unfinished Soviet grain harvest could delay any final
	decision on the timing of another wheat subsidy to Moscow.
	    The future of the U.S./Soviet long-term grains agreement
	will be discussed the first of next year, Lyng said, but the
	Agriculture Secretary questioned the benefits of the
	long-standing agreement.
	    "We've had three years in a row in which the Soviets have
	failed to live up to their end of the agreement ... We would
	love to continue to keep doing busines with the Soviet Union,
	but do we need a long-term agreement. Who benefits from that.
	These are some of the questions we need to discuss."
	    When asked if he felt the United States has benefitted from
	the agreement, Lyng said, "I don't know. It certainly hasn't
	been what we had hoped it would be. For three years running
	they've (Moscow) failed to live up to what we considered was an
	agreement."

CONTENT:
	U.S. Senate Republican leader Robert
	Dole said Congress should consider legislation to apply the
	so-called 0/92 option to producers of major commodities.
	    Dole told the National Corn Growers Association that he
	thought the proposal, supported by the Reagan administration,
	"should be seriously considered" because a refusal to do so could
	"play into the hands of those who want mandatory controls" placed
	on production.
	    However, Dole did not say whether he would support the 0/92
	option, which would offer producers at least 92 pct of their
	income support payments regardless of how much they planted.
	    The Senate Republican leader said the 0/92 option posed two
	problems. First, it is viewed, he said, by some as welfare. In
	addition, debate on the proposal could open up the whole farm
	bill, Dole said.
	    Dole also repeated his call for an across-the-board export
	enhancement program, saying a subsidy offer to the Soviet Union
	could help improve U.S. relations with that country.
	    Dole said that the United States has made the decision to
	trade with Moscow and that it's important to offer competitive
	prices.
	    The senator predicted Congress would have to decide this
	year whether to require an expansion of the export subsidy
	program, which currently targets benefits to recapture markets
	lost to other suppliers which subsidize.
	    Dole, who last year pledged to offer legislation to require
	a marketing loan for major crops but never did so, again called
	for the marketing loan for wheat and feedgrains.
	    The Reagan administration's proposed farm policy changes
	"are not going anywhere" this year, Dole said, singling out the
	proposal to cut target prices 10 pct per year.
	    Asked by reporters after his speech whether he sensed a
	shift in the State Department towards supporting an export
	enhancement initiative for the Soviet Union, Dole said he
	didn't see any change.
	    Dole also said it would be a very close call in the Senate
	whether to open up the farm bill to general debate this year.
	    Dole said he was encouraged by the selection of Republican
	David Karnes to replace the late Sen. Edward Zorinsky (D-Neb.)

	SHULTZ USSR TRIP FUELS TALK OF EEP WHEAT OFFER
TOPICS:

CONTENT:
	Speculation the United States will
	offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union appears to have
	reached a new level of intensity in the run-up to Secretary of
	State George Shultz' visit later this month to Moscow.
	    Rumors of an impending deal have coursed through wheat
	markets since officials from the two countries held their
	customary, semi-annual grain talks in February. Moscow's
	decision at that time to reenter the U.S. corn market
	strengthened the perception of warming farm trade prospects.
	    Shultz is set to arrive in Moscow April 13.
	    Shultz' statement two weeks ago that he would not stand in
	the way of a wheat subsidy offer under the Export Enhancement
	Program, EEP, coupled with the announcement of his visit to
	Moscow, was interpreted by many grain trade representatives
	here as a clear signal that the Reagan administration was
	preparing an offer.
	    Administration officials -- in and out of the U.S.
	Agriculture Department -- have been extremely tight-lipped
	about the prospects of a subsidy offer.
	    But USDA officials for the most part have abandoned the
	contention the proposal is dormant, suggesting that an offer,
	while not a "done deal," is a live possibility.
	    Prominent U.S. grain trade representatives -- many of whom
	asked not to be identified -- continue to maintain that an
	offer to subsidize four mln tonnes of wheat is imminent.
	    Others, who one month ago claimed a deal was not possible,
	are saying they would not rule one out.
	    Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., yesterday went so far as to
	predict a subsidy offer would be made within the next ten days
	to two weeks.
	    Aides to Roberts said he had spoken to Republican leaders
	who had been in contact with administration officials.
	    Richard Fritz, director of international marketing at U.S.
	Wheat Associates, said he was confident an export enhancement
	offer would be made by the middle of this month.
	    Fritz also said he thought the value of the bonus would end
	up being close to the offer Washington made Peking earlier this
	year when USDA approved subsidies to China of around 36 dlrs
	per tonne on one mln tonnes of wheat.
	    Some grain trade representatives say a four-mln-tonne wheat
	subsidy offer might help stimulate more Soviet purchases of
	U.S. corn and open the door to U.S. sales of soybeans.
	    As ever, one of the crucial sticking points in a wheat deal
	would appear to be price.
	    Last summer the administration took the controversial step
	of offering the Soviets subsidized wheat -- but were
	embarrassed when Moscow spurned the proposal on the grounds
	that the 15-dlr-per-tonne subsidy still left U.S. wheat prices
	far above world market prices.
	    The administration's decision to set the subsidy level up
	front instead of accepting bids from exporters appeared to be a
	means of controlling the price while attempting to dampen
	criticism, grain trade sources said.
	    Nonetheless, the pricing procedure did not prevent Shultz
	from saying the Soviets were "chortling" because Washington was
	offering Soviet housewives cheaper grain than that available to
	U.S. housewives.
	    The conventional wisdom among grain trade representatives
	here is that a general warming of relations between the two
	countries since last summer, combined with continued hard times
	in the U.S. grain belt, would favor a subsidy offer.
	    In addition, the USSR has made it clear it would consider
	buying U.S. wheat if it were priced more competitively.
	    However, observers have not forgotten the circumstances
	surrounding the administration's announcement of the wheat
	subsidy offer last summer.
	    Up until the time of the announcment, congressional and
	industry leaders were led to believe the White House had
	decided to expand the Export Enhancement Program to include not
	only the Soviets, but also a much broader list of countries.
	    Instead, the administration scaled back the offer to
	include only the Soviets.
	    That last-minute change of heart adds a measure of
	uncertainty even to the predictions of those most convinced
	that the administration will not now pass up the opportunity to
	sell four mln tonnes of wheat to the Soviet Union.

	U.S. WHEAT BONUS TO SOVIET CALLED DORMANT

CONTENT:
	The U.S. Agriculture Department is not
	actively considering offering subsidized wheat to the Soviet
	Union under the export enhancement program (EEP), senior USDA
	officials said.
	    However, grain trade analysts said the proposal has not
	been ruled out and that an offer might be made, though not in
	the very near future.
	    "The grain companies are trying to get this fired up again,"
	an aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said. "But there
	just isn't much talk about it, informally or formally."
	    Most analysts interviewed by Reuters were more confident
	than USDA officials that bonus wheat would be offered to the
	Soviets, even though U.S. officials did not make such an offer
	when they held grain talks with Soviet counterparts earlier
	this week.
	    But administration and private sources agreed that if the
	Reagan administration did decide to offer subsidized wheat to
	Moscow, it could take several months.
	    "I just don't see any proposal like that sailing through any
	interagency process," the aide to Lyng said.
	    "An export enhancement offer is not consummated overnight,"
	said one former USDA official, who noted that the
	administration took three months to decide in favor of selling
	China wheat under the subsidy program.
	    An official representing a large grain trade company said
	deliberations within USDA might be nudged along by members of
	Congress, a number of whom urged USDA this week to make a wheat
	subsidy offer to the Soviets.
	    But Lyng's aide said that during a day-long visit to
	Capitol Hill yesterday, House members did not press the
	secretary on the subsidy question a single time.
	    The administration's interagency trade policy review group,
	comprised of subcabinet-level officials, has not been asked to
	clear a request to offer Moscow wheat under the EEP, officials
	at the U.S. Trade Representative's Office said.
	    In their talks this week, the two sides discussed the
	administration's previous EEP offer but did not talk about any
	new initiative. One USDA official who took part in the
	consultations this week described them as an exchange of "calm,
	basic, factual economics."
	    Another USDA official said there was "not even an informal
	suggestion or hint" that the Soviets would live up to their
	pledge to buy four mln tonnes of wheat this year if they were
	granted more favorable terms.
	    USDA and private sources agreed that consideration of an
	EEP initiative by interagency review groups likely would be
	delayed because of disarray within the White House stemming
	from the Iran arms affair.

	SHULTZ NOT OPPOSED TO WHEAT SUBSIDY TO SOVIETS
TOPICS:

CONTENT:
	Secretary of State George Shultz has
	decided not to oppose any U.S. wheat subsidy offer to the
	Soviet Union and has left the final decision on whether to sell
	subsidized wheat to Moscow up to President Reagan and the
	Agriculture Department, a State Department official said.
	    "Shultz feels like he fought the battle against a subsidy
	last summer, and he's not going to the mat again. It's now
	basically the USDA who has to make their decisions as to what
	they want to do," the official said.
	    If USDA decides to go ahead with a subsidy offer to the
	Soviet Union, he said, "Shultz will not wage a vigorous
	campaign against it. He might not come out in favor of it, but
	he won't go to the President and voice his objections."
	    In an official statement clarifying Shultz's remarks
	yesterday to leaders of the National Association of Wheat
	Growers, the State Department said, "Secretary Shultz expressed
	his belief that whenever possible, U.S. grain should be
	competitive on world markets, including the Soviet Union.
	    The Agriculture Department is in the best position to
	determine whether consideration should be given at this time to
	extending to the Soviets a subsidy under the Export Enhancement
	Program."
	    Although Shultz will not oppose a wheat subsidy to the
	Soviets, there remain obstacles to another subsidy offer to
	Moscow, the State Department official said.
	    "Everyone in the government agrees that if there is a
	subsidy to be offered, we would not offer it unless we had a
	firm commitment from the Soviets that they would buy."
	    USDA does not want a repetition of last summer when the
	USSR baulked at its offer of four mln tonnes of subsidized
	wheat, the official, who asked not to be identified, said.
	    The Soviets rejected the U.S. offer then on the grounds
	that the 13 dlr per tonne subsidy was insufficient to bring
	U.S. prices down to competitive levels.
	    The Soviets want a higher subsidy offer this time, the
	State Department source said.
	    "What the Soviets want is something equivalent to the
	lowest price being paid by anyone in the world," he said.
	    The Soviets argue that they are the best customer of the
	U.S. and that they are entitled to the best price, he said.
	    Government and commodity sources also said there are
	elements in the USDA, most notably undersecretary Daniel
	Amstutz, who remain opposed to a wheat subsidy to the Soviets.
	    "Subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union is still not a
	foregone conclusion," the State Department official said.

	U.S. GRAIN TRADE CALLS SHULTZ REMARK SIGNIFICANT
TOPICS:
	grain, wheat
PLACES:
	usa, ussr
CONTENT:
	A statement yesterday by Secretary
	of State George Shultz after he met with wheat growers that
	U.S. agricultural products must be competitively priced was
	significant in that he recognized the importance of the Soviet
	market and the need for U.S. prices to be at world market
	levels, U.S. grain trade industry officials said.
	    They said that Shultz's comments, while not explicitly
	endorsing subsidized wheat sales to the USSR, were noteworthy
	because they were not negative towards such action.
	    In response to a query on what the State Department's
	position is on selling subsidized wheat to Moscow, Shultz told
	the leaders of the National Association of Wheat Growers that
	prices must be competitive if the U.S. is going to trade.
	    The Soviet Union, the world's largest grain importer, has
	bought no U.S. wheat for more than a year, complaining the
	price was far above world market levels. A U.S. offer last fall
	to sell the Soviets lower-priced wheat through the export
	enhancement program, EEP, was also rebuffed due to the price.
	    Shultz was said to be adamantly against the U.S. wheat
	offer last year and has been reported to be one of the major
	obstacles in making another subsidy overture to the Soviet
	Union, grain industry sources said.
	    Intense speculation the U.S. might make a fresh EEP wheat
	offer to the Soviets has boosted grain prices significantly in
	recent trading sessions. Kansas City hard wheat futures rose
	another 2-1/4 cents by midday at 2.88-1/4 dlrs per bushel,
	while CBT March wheat was up 1-1/2 cents at 2.92-1/2 dlrs.
	    "I'm not sure this is an about-face, but it's clearly a
	recognition that unless we're competitive, we won't sell to the
	Soviet Union," said a lobbyst for a major commodity group.
	    "We have to be competitive. It's ridiculous to say that
	somebody is going to buy your product if they can get the same
	thing at a lower price somewhere else," Shultz told the farm
	leaders. "That is our approach in negotiations with the
	Soviets," he said.
	    If those comments do signal that the State Department is no
	longer opposed to the U.S. selling wheat to the USSR under EEP,
	it certainly improves the chances for an EEP wheat offer to
	Moscow, an industry lobbyst said.
	    National Wheat Grower's officials were taking a cautious
	attitude towards the secretary's comments.
	    "His comments were not discouraging, but they didn't in our
	judgment promise any immediate action on EEP," an official with
	the wheat group said.
	    The Wheat Growers official noted, however, that "there is
	significance in that fact that we haven't seen any significant
	negative commentary on the idea of EEP wheat to the Soviets."
	    In a meeting with exporters this week, Secretary of
	Agriculture Richard Lyng refused to comment on their request
	that the administration offer subsidized wheat to Moscow, the
	officials said.
	    An aide to USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz, who is
	reported to be strongly opposed to EEP wheat to the Soviets,
	said that the Shultz comments "are consistent with what he
	(Shultz) has taught for years as an economist," but said they
	don't necessarily relate to the Soviet Union.
	    Amstutz could not be reached for comment, and an aide to
	Lyng said Lyng would not comment on Shultz's statements.
	    But trade sources were hopeful that the Shultz comments may
	indicate some movement towards EEP wheat to Moscow.
	    "If he didn't say no, then there's a chance. This is
	potentially a positive development," a commodity source said.

	obtained confidential information about the company to make its

	    Samjens last week topped a 76 dlr per share offer for
	Burlington from Morgan Stanley Group <MS> by one dlr per share.
	Morgan Stanley made its 2.44 billion dlr bid after Samjens bid
	72 dlrs per share for Burlington.
	    Burlington lawyers told the court if the injunction is not
	granted Samjens would win control of Burlington. A Samjens
	lawyer argued that if the judge granted the injunction it would
	"kill the offer"
	    Jay Greenfield, an attorney for Samjens, said the
	partnership would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction
	were granted. "There's only one Burlington," he said. "If we
	cannot get that then no amount of money can compensate us."
	    Greenfield also said Samjens could sell its holdings in

	BOARD REJECTS HYDRO-QUEBEC SALES TO NEW ENGLAND

	Canada's National Energy Board has
	denied an application by Quebec-owned Hydro-Quebec to export
	about three billion Canadian dlrs worth of electricity to the
	New England states, a board spokeswoman told Reuters.
	    The decision is to be made public later today, chief
	information officer Ann Sicotte said.
	    Sicotte said the board rejected tha application after four
	months of hearings because Hydro-Quebec did not offer the
	electricity first to Canadian provinces and could not prove it
	was surplus to Canadian needs.
	    Sicotte said Hydro-Quebec can apply for a review of the
	decision if there are new facts or changed circumstances, and
	could also launch an appeal with the federal court or file a
	new application.
	    Hydro-Quebec spokesman Maurice Hebert said the utility had
	not yet been officially notified and will have to study the
	decision before deciding what action to take.
	    The contract was a 10-year agreement with power exports
	beginning in 1990. "They weren't able to demonstrate that the
	electricity was surplus and one way to demonstrate that is by
	offering it to neighboring provinces," Sicotte said.
	    Hebert said the utility argued that it can generate  enough
	electricity to supply its U.S. and Canadian customers.
	    "Our position is that electricity is a manufactured
	product--so everyboday can manufacture it and anybody can buy
	some--if they (the provinces) want to buy some from us, we're
	willing to discuss it," he said.
	    The application is the first the National Energy Board has
	rejected outright, Sicotte said.
	    New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland had
	opposed the contract at Energy Board hearings this spring.

	KANSAS LEGISLATOR PREDICTS EEP WHEAT TO SOVIETS

	Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., predicted
	the Reagan administration within the next ten days to two weeks
	will offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union under the
	Export Enhancement Program, EEP.
	    Roberts made the comment at a press conference held by
	Republican members of the House Agriculture Committee.
	    He did not say on what he based the comment, but an aide
	said Roberts had been in touch with top Republican officials
	recently.
	    The possibility of an expansion of EEP to include wheat to
	Moscow has been rumored for some time, and some industry
	sources believe a decision on the issue will be made by the
	Reagan administration before Secretary of State George Shultz
	goes to Moscow in April.

	Speculation the United States will
	offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union appears to have
	reached a new level of intensity in the run-up to Secretary of
	State George Shultz' visit later this month to Moscow.
	    Rumors of an impending deal have coursed through wheat
	markets since officials from the two countries held their
	customary, semi-annual grain talks in February. Moscow's
	decision at that time to reenter the U.S. corn market
	strengthened the perception of warming farm trade prospects.
	    Shultz is set to arrive in Moscow April 13.
