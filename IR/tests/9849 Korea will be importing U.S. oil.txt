	South Korea is studying a plan to buy

	crude oil to help reduce its huge trade surplus with the United
	States, Energy Ministry officials said today.
	    They said the plan would dominate discussions at two-day
	energy talks between officials of the two countries in
	Washington from April 1.
	    Huh Sun-yong, who will attend the talks with three other

	"positively considering buying a certain amount of Alaskan oil
	beginning this year as part of our government's overall plan to

	CANADA MAY MONITOR STEEL SHIPMENTS

	Canada may begin monitoring steel
	flowing in and out of the country to determine if any steel is
	being illegally "trans-shipped" to the U.S., senior government
	trade officials said.
	    The officials, asking not to be identified, said the
	government will investigate an industry contention that steel 
	imported from countries such as South Korea and Taiwan is being
	diverted to the U.S. and ultimately exasperating concerns about
	the level of Canadian exports south of the border.
	    But the senior officials, asking not to be indentified,
	said that despite intense pressure from the Reagan
	Administration, Ottawa was not considering any kind of formal
	limits on Canadian shipments to the U.S.
	    "In a sense what I hope we are doing is buying some time,"
	said one official who claimed Canadian companies were "fair
	traders" in the big American market.
	    If approved by the Canadian cabinet, the officials said a 
	monitoring system will be established in the next three or four
	months.
	    "I guess if we find trans-shipment is a problem, we would
	have to do something about it," said a trade official.
	    Canadian steel shipments to the U.S. have risen to 5.7 pct
	of the U.S. market in recent months, almost double the level
	just two years ago.
	    The increase in Canadian shipments comes at a time of
	growing anger in the U.S. over rising steel imports from
	several countries in the face of a decline among domestic steel
	producers.
	    Some U.S. lawmakers have proposed Canada's share of the
	American market be limited to 2.4 per cent.
	    The Ontario Government has urged Ottawa to require foreign
	companies to obtain permits to import steel into the country.
	Currently, import licences are required only for carbon or raw
	steel, which makes up less than half the steel market.
	    Canada exported two billion Canadian dlrs worth of steel in
	1986, while importing 944-mln dlrs worth of the product in the
	same year.

	SMUGGLING BLAMED FOR CLOSURE OF HAITIAN SUGAR FIRM
TOPICS:

PLACES:
	haiti
CONTENT:
	A sugar mill which was this
	nation's second largest employer closed its doors yesterday,
	saying it had been run out of business by sugar smuggled from
	Miami and the neighbouring Dominican Republic.
	    The closure of the Haitian American Sugar Company (HASCO)
	will idle 3,500 employees and affect as many as 30,000 to
	40,000 small sugar cane planters in regions around the capital,
	the company said.
	    "Because of unprecedented and ever-growing smuggling, HASCO
	regrets ... It cannot continue to accept delivery of sugar cane
	after April 10," the mill warned planters earlier this week.
	    Since President Jean-Claude Duvalier fled Haiti fourteen
	months ago, widescale smuggling of basic goods such as cooking
	oil, flour, rice, sugar and canned milk has lowered consumer
	prices but bankrupted several local manufacturers, throwing
	hundreds of thousands of Haitians out of work.
	    At the HASCO compound, where grim-faced workers lined up to
	receive their last pay, Spokesman Georges D. Rigaud showed a
	warehouse stocked with an estimated 445,000 unsold 100-pound
	(45-kg) bags of sugar.
	    "We are closing because of our huge stock of unsold sugar.
	We have no money left to continue operations," Rigaud said.
	    He said the company owed 7.6 mln dlrs and had borrowed an
	additional 1.5 mln dlrs in order to pay off workers.
	    Rigaud blamed the mill's problems on an order by Duvalier
	two years ago forbidding HASCO from refining sugar.
	    He said the government then began importing refined sugar
	at world market prices and reselling it at a huge profit and
	the provisional military-civilian government that replaced
	Duvalier last year continued the policy.
	    "But now with all the smuggling even the state can't compete
	with smuggled Dominican refined sugar," Rigaud said.
	    HASCO workers earned 4.20 dlrs daily, considerably above
	the usual minimum wage of three dlrs.
	    It is generally estimated that every employed Haitian
	supports at least six people. Rigaud said HASCO's closing at a
	minimum would affect 280,000 to 300,000 people.
	    Laid-off workers were bitter about the closure. "We're dead,
	and it's the government that's causing us to die," declared
	Lucien Felix, 34, who has five dependents.

	TOKYO STOCKS OUTLOOK UNCERTAIN DUE TO YEN, OPEC
TOPICS:
	
PLACES:
	japan
CONTENT:
	Prospects for Tokyo stocks are mixed this
	week with investors trying to figure out the future of the
	yen/dollar exchange rate and digest the implications of OPEC's
	latest accord on crude output and pricing, brokers said.
	    They said the market should extend the dull trend it has
	been in since the 225-share index fell rapidly from the record
	close at 25,929.42 on June 17.
	    It ended at 24,902.72 on Saturday and fell further this
	morning to close at 24,707.68 in an uncertain reaction to the
	weaker yen and the weekend OPEC accord.
	    Brokers said attention could focus more on the cheaper,
	less well-known stocks in the exchange's first and second
	sections, which were generally showing more resilience. The
	second section index, in contrast to the first, closed at a
	record 2,404.64 on June 26, surpassing the peak set on June 17
	of 2,401.71.
	    "Probably shares of companies involved in the domestic
	economy are a good bet," said a broker at Daiwa Securities Co
	Ltd. He said his observation was based on figures showing that
	business activity in Japan is booming.
	    The government said on Friday that department store and
	supermarket sales rose 7.5 pct in May from a year earlier,
	while orders received by Japan's 50 major construction firms in
	the same month were up 7.6 pct year on year. Brokers expected
	more such figures, but said many stocks linked to domestic
	demand remain overpriced.
	    "They are hard to find, but companies with an attractive
	niche in the domestic economy, unaffected by currency
	movements, are the best bet," said a broker at a foreign
	securities house who declined to be identified.
	    But sharp rises in money supply and voracious domestic
	consumption are stirring inflation fears. The consumer price
	index rose 0.2 pct in May from April, the third consecutive
	month on month increase.
	    Although investors are not unduly worried about inflation,
	which erodes the real value of stock holdings, they say rising
	prices arouse concern that interest rates may climb.
	    The recent market advances have been assuming a further cut
	in Japan's 2.5 pct discount rate. Such assumptions have now
	died, discouraging investors, brokers said.
	    If oil prices rise, the stock market in Japan could suffer
	a downturn as higher production costs stir inflation.
	    But share prices of Japan's oil importing companies may
	also firm, brokers said. "I have never been able to justify this
	because it should mean that the cost of importing rises," said a
	broker at Yamaichi Securities Co. "It just always happens."
	    Export-oriented companies may continue their recent rally
	if the dollar climbs against the yen. But prices of many blue
	chip exporters have risen fast over the last two weeks, making
	them look less attractive, brokers said.
	    However, if the dollar falls to about 140 or 138 yen, the
	market index may rally, brokers said. A lower dollar could damp
	down rising capital outflows into dollar investments from
	Japan's stock and bond markets, brokers said.
	    And as the yen/dollar rate is supposed to reflect the
	balance of trade between the United States and Japan, a lower
	dollar would bring more pressure on Japan to expand its demand
	for American imports by stimulating its local economy, brokers
	said.
	    "If the dollar falls, buy domestic, if it rises, maybe buy a
	few exporters," said one foreign broker.

	DRESDNER BANK UNIT SAYS NOT WORRIED ON BRAZIL DEBT
TOPICS:
	
PLACES:
	west-germany, brazil, mexico
CONTENT:
	Deutsch-Suedamerikanische Bank AG, a
	wholly owned subsidiary of Dresdner Bank AG <DRSD.F>, said it
	was not worried about Brazil stopping its interest payments.
	    Board member Herbert Mittendorf told a news conference that
	Brazil's example was unlikely to be followed by other Latin
	American countries.
	    He pointed out that the region's debt rose by only 2.8 pct
	last year to a total 396 billion dlrs. The countries' efforts
	to further economic growth and to consolidate budgets were "not
	unsuccessful." But the slump in oil prices and the decline in
	commodity prices hampered these efforts, he said.
	    Latin American countries' exports fell last year by about
	16 pct to 80 billion dlrs, with imports declining slightly to
	around 65 billion dlrs, Mittendorf said.
	    The region's 1986 trade surplus was halved to an estimated
	15 billion dlrs, he said. The cut in exchange earnings of oil
	exporting countries was only partly offset by the advantages
	gained by the region's oil importing states, he noted.
	    The region's principal debtors are Brazil and Mexico, each
	owing about 100 billion dlrs at the end of last year, followed
	by Argentina with around 49 billion dlrs, Venezuela with 33
	billion and Chile with 20 billion dlrs debt.
	    Deutsch-Suedamerikanische Bank welcomed Mexico joining the
	General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in mid 1986,
	which it saw as an effort to integrate the country to a larger
	extent into the world economy.
	    However, realistic exchange rates were needed if the debtor
	countries were to compete in the world market, Mittendorf said.
	    In this respect an easing of protectionist barriers was
	imperative, he said.
	    The conversion of debt into equity was regarded as an
	important additional step towards debt consolidation.
	    West German exports to Latin America declined by 4.1 pct in
	1986 to 11 billion marks. Shipments to Mexico fell 19 pct to
	1.9 billion marks and to Colombia by 15 pct to 600 mln marks,
	Mittendorf said.
	    Exports to Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador and Central America were
	also lower last year than in 1985, while shipments to Brazil
	rose 11.5 pct to around two billion marks. Exports to Argentina
	went up by over three pct to 1.5 billion marks and those to
	Paraguay surged by 42 pct to 106 mln marks, he said.
	    Brazil was West Germany's main Latin American supplier, but
	shipments fell to 4.4 billion marks from 6.4 billion in 1985.

	COFFEE TRADERS EXPECT SELLOFF AFTER ICO TALKS FAIL
TOPICS:
	coffee
PLACES:
	uk, usa, brazil, colombia
CONTENT:
	The failure of the International Coffee
	Organization (ICO) to reach agreement on coffee export quotas
	could trigger a massive selloff in London coffee futures of at
	least 100 stg per tonne today, coffee trade sources said.
	    Prices could easily drop to as low as 1.00 dlr or even 80
	cents a lb this year from around 1.25 dlrs now, they said.
	    A special meeting between importing and exporting countries
	ended in a deadlock late yesterday after eight days of talks
	over how to set the quotas. No further meeting to discuss
	quotas was set, delegates said.
	    Quotas, the major device used to stabilize prices under the
	International Coffee Agreement, were suspended a year ago after
	prices soared following a damaging drought in Brazil.
	    With no propects for quotas in sight, heavy producer
	selling initially and a price war among commercial coffee
	roasting companies will ensue, the trade sources predicted.
	    Lower prices are sure to trickle down to the supermarket
	shelf this spring, coffee dealers said.
	    The U.S. And Brazil, the largest coffee importer and
	exporter respectively, each laid the blame on the other for the
	breakdown of the talks.
	    Jon Rosenbaum, U.S. Assistant trade representative and
	delegate to the talks, said in a statement after the council
	adjourned, "A majority of producers, led by Brazil, were not
	prepared to negotiate a new distribution based on objective
	criteria.
	    "We want to insure that countries receive export quotas
	based on their ability to supply the market, instead of their
	political influence in the ICO."
	    Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC) President Jorio Dauster
	countered, "Negotiations failed because consumers tried to
	dictate quotas, not negotiate them."
	    Previously, quotas were determined by historical amounts
	exported, which gave Brazil a 30 pct share of a global market
	of about 58 mln 60-kilo bags. A majority of producers wanted
	quotas to continue under this basic scheme.
	    But most consumers and a maverick group of eight producers
	proposed carving up the export market on the basis of
	exportable production and stocks, which would reduce Brazil's
	share to 28.8 pct.
	    Consumer delegates said this method would reflect changes
	in many countries' export capabilities and make coffee more
	readily available to consumers when they need it.
	    A last-minute attempt by Colombia, the second largest
	exporter, to rescue the talks with a compromise interim
	proposal could not bring the two sides together.
	    Delegates speculated Brazil's financial problems,
	illustrated by its recent suspension of interest payments on
	bank debt, have increased political pressure on the country to
	protect its coffee export earnings.
	    Developing coffee-producing countries that depend heavily
	on coffee earnings, particularly some African nations and
	Colombia, are likely to be hurt the most by the ICO's failure
	to agree quotas, analysts said.
	    The expected drop in prices could result in losses of as
	much as three billion dlrs in a year, producer delegates
	forecast.
	    The ICO executive board will meet March 31, but the full
	council is not due to meet again until September, delegates
	said.

	COMMODITY PACTS MORE ORIENTED TOWARDS MARKET

CONTENT:
	Consuming countries, chastened by the
	collapse of International Tin Council (ITC) price support
	operations in 1985, are insisting more than ever before that
	commodity pacts reflect the reality of the markets they are
	serving, a Reuter survey showed.
	    They want price ranges to be more responsive to market
	trends - to avoid overstimulating output and straining the
	accords' support operations - and intervention rules that avoid
	the risk of exports by non-members undermining the pacts.
	Consumers and producers, mindful of ITC buffer stock losses,
	have also sought strict conditions for buffer operations.
	    Importers and some key exporting countries have shunned a
	generalised approach to commodity price stabilisation and
	prefer to assess each commodity case by case, the survey
	showed.
	    The International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) last week set
	precise limits on what the Buffer Stock Manager (BSM) could do
	under the new agreement. It imposed daily and weekly purchase
	limits, prohibited the BSM from operating on futures markets
	and stipulated, after consumer insistence, that up to 15 pct of
	total buffer stock purchases could be of non-member cocoa. This
	will help prevent lower quality cocoa from Malaysia, the
	world's fourth largest producer, undermining the market.
	    The cocoa pact establishes precise differentials the Buffer
	Stock Manager must use when purchasing varying grades.
	    A new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA) was
	adopted earlier this month in Geneva. Importing and exporting
	countries agreed several changes to make the reference price
	more responsive to market trends and they eliminated provisions
	under which the buffer stock could borrow from banks to finance
	operations. Direct cash contributions from members will fund
	buffer stock purchases. Bank financing was a particular feature
	of the failed ITC buffer stock which suffered losses running
	into hundreds of millions of sterling. Legal wrangles continue.
	    Recent International Coffee Organization (ICO) negotiations
	in London exemplified the degree to which consumers insist that
	agreements reflect market reality, commodity analysts said.
	    Consumers and a small group of producers argued that
	"objective criteria" should be used to define export quota
	shares, which would have meant a reduction in the share of
	Brazil, the world's leading producer. Brazil wanted to maintain
	its previous quota share of 30 pct. The talks broke down and,
	although an ICO executive board meeting starts in London today,
	delegates and trade sources see chances of any near term
	negotiations on export quota distribution as remote.
	    International agreements exist for sugar and wheat. These
	do not have any economic clauses but provide a forum for
	discussions on possible future economic agreements, collect
	statistics and draw up market analyses. Analysts said
	differences between sugar exporting countries have held up any
	progress towards an accord with economic teeth, while sheer
	competition between major exporters amid a world grain glut
	militate against any pact with economic provisions for wheat.
	    An alternative focus for commodity discussions are
	international study groups, made up of governments with advice
	from industry, such as those for lead and zinc and rubber.
	    The U.N. Common fund for commodities, with a planned
	directly contributed capital of 470 mln dlrs, has failed to
	become operational because neither the U.S. Nor the Soviet
	Union has ratified it. U.S. Officials in Washington said the
	U.S. Doubts the fund would be able to fulfil its objectives,
	citing the lack of widespread support.
	    U.S. Officials in Washington and Malaysian officials in
	Kuala Lumpur expressed a policy of looking at each commodity
	pact case by case. U.S. Officials said it has been willing to
	study individual cases for economically sound, market-oriented
	commodity accords balancing producer and consumer interests.
	    "We see little to be gained by attempting to increase the
	price of a commodity whose long-term trend is downward,"
	official Administration policy states. The U.S. Currently
	belongs to only two international commodity agreements that
	have economic clauses - the International Coffee Agreement
	(ICA) and INRA - but it is also a member of the sugar and wheat
	pacts.
	    The U.S. Did not join the International Cocoa Agreement
	because it considered its proposed price ranges unrealistic and
	not designed to protect the interests of consuming countries,
	the State Department said. U.S. Officials singled out the INRA
	as the one commodity agreement that seems to be working.
	    U.S. Negotiators were successful in getting other members
	of the pact to agree that the price review and adjustment
	mechanism of the rubber agreement would accurately reflect
	market trends and also to continue the accord as a market
	oriented agreement, U.S. Officials said.
	    Canadian officials in Ottawa also said they have
	consistently tried to look at membership of commodity pacts on
	the merits of each case. Malaysian Primary Industries Minister
	Lim Keng Yaik told Reuters in Kuala Lumpur his country, the
	world's top producer of rubber, tin and palm oil, decides its
	participation in international commodity pacts case by case.
	    Malaysia is a member of the Association of Tin Producing
	Countries (ATPC) which produce 65 pct of world tin. The ATPC
	launched a plan to limit member tin exports to 96,000 tonnes
	for a year from March to cut the tin surplus to 50,000 from
	70,000.
	    Economist in the West German Ministry of Agriculture and
	delegate to cocoa, wheat and sugar agreements Peter Baron told
	Reuters in London, "Agreements with economic clauses to
	stabilise prices could function if fixed price ranges were
	close to market reality, if there was full participation by
	producers and consumers, and if participants were prepared to
	take their obligations in the framework of the agreement
	seriously."
	    But Baron added, "No real sanctions are available for a
	country that doesn't stick to its obligations...The German
	approach is sceptical. We don't think agreements are the best
	instrument to help developing countries. They were never meant
	to be a vehicle for the transfer of resources and that is how
	developing countries often interpret them."
	    Traditionally Britain has always been supportive of
	commodity agreements, reflecting its strong links with Third
	World producing countries. But recently demands for more
	stringent and justifiable pacts with emphasis placed on the
	need for "intellectual honesty" and "objective criteria" have
	grown.
	    British officials stress the need for commodity pacts to be
	a two way partnership in trade rather than a disguise for aid.
	    It is now seen as essential that any pacts involving direct
	market participation through a buffer stock have a high degree
	of transparency and do not contain the risk of open-ended
	borrowing that occurred in the tin pact, they said. U.K.
	Delegates talk of stabilisation and the need for prices to
	reflect changes in market structure and price trends rather
	than dictate what prices should be.
	    A Foreign Ministry official in Tokyo said Japan urges price
	realism in commodity pacts, adding high prices inflate supply.
	    A government spokesman in Paris said France is favourable
	to commodity pacts. France, a large consumer and producer of
	sugar, favours a sugar pact as long as it reflects the real
	market situation, particularly regarding stocks.
	    Indonesia's Foreign Minister Mochtar Kusumaatmadja told
	Reuters in Jakarta: "These agreements can work as long as the
	problems are cyclical..But it's another matter when there are
	structural problems..But we are still committed to commodity
	agreements as an act of faith." Nicaraguan External Trade
	Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca said in London producers
	cannot afford not to give their backing to commodity
	agreements.
	    "The political will is not there on the part of some
	consumers to make agreements work," Martinez Cuenca said.
	    The head of the economics department in the Brazilian
	Foreign Ministry, Sebastiao do Rego Barros, told Reuters an
	agreement can be successful if it keeps a link with market
	reality. If you have an agreement such as coffee with a system
	of quotas, with a link between prices practised inside the pact
	and actual market prices, it can work. UNCTAD spokesman Graham
	Shanley said consuming countries realise steady export earnings
	enhance developing countries' ability to service debt and mean
	greater demand for industrialised nations' capital goods.
