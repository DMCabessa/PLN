	Securities and Exchange Commission
	Chairman John Shad said the SEC favors shortening the current
	10-day period for disclosing takeover attempts but opposes
	putting restrictions on the use of so-called junk bonds.
	    "We favor shortening the disclosure period to two days,"
	Shad told members of the House Telecommunications and Finance
	subcommittee when asked for his recommendation.
	    He said the SEC's responsibility was to provide full
	disclosure for securities, including junk bonds, and not to
	make decisions based on merit. He said junk bonds had some
	value because of their liquidity.
	    Shad said he opposes proposals to require those attempting
	takeovers to file a statement on the impact the takeover would
	have on the communities involved.
	    "We've opposed it in the past. It goes far beyond investor
	protection," Shad said.
	    He said he had no comment on a proposal by House Speaker
	Jim Wright, D- Texas, to tax securities transactions.

	DREXEL SAYS BUSINESS STRONG DESPITE TRADE PROBE
TOPICS:
	
PLACES:

CONTENT:
	Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc said
	Wednesday its business is booming, despite its inability to
	distance itself from the insider trading scandal that has
	spread rumors and doubts through Wall Street.
	    "For a company that's supposed to be under siege, we are
	doing extremely well. We are exceedingly profitable," a
	spokesman for the firm told Reuters.
	    The rumors that have swirled around Drexel, more than any
	other broker, have involved concerns that its business will be
	threatened by the Federal probe, say Wall Street sources. The
	firm has long been at the leading edge of the mergers business
	and had ties to now-disgraced speculator Ivan Boesky.
	    In the latest chapter of the story, Drexel said that some
	commodities firms have begun to limit the amount of business
	they will do with the firm, citing credit risks. Drexel has
	long been a powerful competitor in precious metals markets.
	    But Drexel spokesman Steve Anredder told Reuters that
	Drexel's overall business is proceeding normally and the
	first-quarter profit "could be the strongest of anybody on Wall
	Street."
	    "I wouldn't say we're not feeling any effect (from the
	trading probes)," he said. "But we're doing extremely well."
	    The firm was among the first to be subpoenaed in the
	government's wide-ranging probe of illegal trading involving
	the use of confidential company information on Wall Street.
	    Believed to be under particular scrutiny was Drexel's "junk
	bond" operation -- the issuance of high-risk speculative debt
	that it pioneered for financing corporate takeovers.
	    "We have done nothing wrong," said the Drexel spokesman.
	"After a thorough investigation, we have found no evidence of
	any wrongdoing by the firm or anyone within the firm."
	    The spokesman said that in the aftermath of the Boesky
	arrest, Drexel had not been charged. Nor had any individual at
	the firm been charged with illegal acts while employed by
	Drexel. One of its top merger specialists, Martin Siegel, was
	charged in connection with a former job.
	    Still, more than any other firm on Wall Street, Drexel has
	suffered the consequences of the insider trading probe. To
	begin with, there have been a series of brief shocks in the
	junk bond market, in nervousness linked to rumors that Drexel
	might be in trouble.
	    At one point, Drexel said Wednesday, a large Midwest bank
	refused to allow Drexel-issued bonds as collateral on credit
	lines. Two weeks ago, the restriction was withdrawn, it said.
	    The company also was notified last month that the outside
	insurer of Drexel's individual brokerage accounts had decided
	not to renew coverage. Drexel has set up its own subsidiary
	handling part of the insurance. American International Group
	and a group of British underwriters have handled the rest.
	    Drexel also appears to have lost ground to others in the
	mergers and acquisition business recently, market sources said.
	However, Anredder said that there was no sign that Drexel had
	lost any customers at all owing to the insider trading cases.
	But in citing results for the quarter, the company points
	mostly to other areas of success.
	    Corporate financings have totaled 8 billion dlrs, including
	3 billion dlrs in new junk bonds in the January-March period,
	Drexel said. Drexel maintains the lion's share of this
	lucrative business, trade sources noted.
	    The market for junk bonds, although jittery, "has rallied
	back with a vengeance," Anredder said.
	    Although they see new competition in the junk bond arena,
	market sources concur that Drexel remains king of the hill.
	    While some of the leading Wall Street firms were limiting
	head-to-head dealings with Drexel in the commodity markets 
	based on worries over the credit of the company, the Drexel
	spokesman called this "ridiculous."

TITLE:
	U.S. JUNK BONDS UNAFFECTED BY TEXACO <TX> FILING
TOPICS:
	
PLACES:
	usa
CONTENT:
	Despite a sharp early fall in Texaco
	Inc bonds, the 125 billion dlr U.S. junk bond market was
	largely unaffected by Texaco's weekend filing for protection
	under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, analysts said.
	    "Texaco's filing had little, if any, effect on junk bond
	prices this morning. It should not spill over to the overall
	market like LTV Corp's <LTV> bankruptcy filing did last
	summer," said one analyst.
	    Traders said some Texaco debt issues fell over 30 points
	this morning in thin trading, but recouped about half that.
	    "Because of the Texaco filing, some investors bid down its
	paper to the mid-60 area (around 650 dlrs per 1,000 dlr face
	value) from around 95 Friday," said a dealer in high-yield, low
	rated bonds.
	    "But sellers could not be found at those levels and the
	bids soon rebounded to the 75 to 85 area," he added, referring
	to such issues as Texaco's 13 pct notes of 1991, the 13-1/4s of
	1999 and 13-5/8s of 1994. All were in the mid-90s Friday.
	    The rebound occurred after Standard and Poor's Corp
	downgraded the debt ratings of 8.4 billion dlrs of debt of
	Texaco and its subsidiaries to D, traders noted.
	    S and P cited the weekend bankruptcy filing. The agency
	said it uses the D grade for securities issued by companies in
	Chapter 11 reorganization.
	    Moody's Investors Service Inc followed suit, cutting most
	of the debt of Texaco and its units to Caa.
	    The junk bond market experienced a short-lived downturn
	last summer when LTV's bankruptcy filing sparked worries that
	credit conditions of other steel companies would also worsen.
	    "This is clearly not the case with Texaco," said one
	trader. Because of their high yields, junk bonds have lately
	outperformed investment grade corporates, he and others said.
	    Analysts and portfolio managers said they viewed Texaco's
	bankruptcy filing as a defensive move.
	    Indeed, a Texas State Court of Appeal this morning said the
	bankruptcy petition effectively stays Texaco's obligation under
	Texas law to post a bond in its 10.53 billion dlr litigation
	against Pennzoil Co <PZL>.
	    "The filing was not the result of credit weakness. The
	company got through the oil crisis alright," said one portfolio
	manager.
	    Others who run junk bond portfolios agreed with that
	assessment and said they would still buy high-yield issues.

	U.S. CORPORATE FINANCE - S/P CUT HAS NO EFFECT
TOPICS:
	
PLACES:
	usa
CONTENT:
	In an unusual move, Standard and Poor's
	Corp downgraded a U.S. corporate debt issue soon after it was
	priced for offering late last week.
	    But, unlike a similar action in September 1986, which
	investment bankers said disrupted the financing, the agency's
	rate reduction had no effect this time, traders said.
	    S and P announced Friday afternoon that it cut to B from
	B-plus a 900 mln dlr issue of senior notes due 1994 of Holiday
	Inns Inc, a unit of Holiday Corp <HIA>. The notes were priced
	late Thursday by sole manager Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
	    In a release, Standard and Poor's said the action reflected
	a change in the note issue's terms to an unsecured form of debt
	from secured. That change was made after the agency rated the
	notes on February 20, S and P stated.
	    "We took action as we became aware that the issue's
	structure had changed," said Robert Nelson of S and P. "We
	generally make a distinction between secured and unsecured
	debt, and this was the key factor in our downgrade."
	    A spokesman for Drexel said the action did not affect the
	Holiday Inns deal, which had already sold out to investors by
	late Friday afternoon.
	    "The Holiday notes are trading at 100.50 on a when-issued
	basis," the Drexel spokesman said soon after S and P's
	announcement. The 10-1/2 pct notes had been priced at par.
	    That is a far cry from late September, when S and P
	downgraded a 215 mln dlr issue of subordinated sinking fund
	debentures due 1998 of New World Pictures Ltd <NWP> just hours
	after the pricing. Because of the rating cut to CCC-plus from
	B-minus, the underwriter halted sales and repriced the issue.
	    Sole manager L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin initially
	gave the debentures a 12-1/4 pct coupon and par pricing. It
	then repriced the issue at 97 to yield 12.74 pct.
	    New World Pictures had increased the issue to 215 mln dlrs
	from an original offering of 150 mln dlrs, and that brought in
	S and P. The agency cited the larger financing in its action
	and said it believed the issuer's cash from existing operations
	would not be enough to adequately service debt.
	    An officer with S and P said at the time the rating agency
	was not told beforehand that the issue had been increased in
	size. Usually, issuers and underwriters alert the rating
	agencies to any changes in debt offerings, he said.
	    In both cases, Moody's Investors Service Inc declined to
	follow suit, bond traders noted.
	    Indeed, Moody's announced Friday that its original rating
	of B-1 for the Holiday Inns notes remained appropriate.
	    Moody's pointed out that while the seven-year notes would
	be unsecured obligations of Holiday Inns, the issue would
	benefit from a negative pledge provision and a call for
	specified collateral under certain circumstances.
	    The agency also said the B-1 rating continued to recognize
	a highly leveraged debt structure that would result from
	Holiday's recapitalization program, as well as the company's
	dependence on property sales to produce adequate cash flow for
	near-term debt service.
	    "Aside from Holiday Inns and New World Pictures, I cannot
	remember the last time an issue was downgraded so soon after
	the pricing," remarked one corporate bond trader.
	    Holiday Inns also sold Thursday via Drexel 500 mln dlrs of
	subordinated debentures due 1999 with an 11 pct coupon and par
	pricing. The debentures' ratings of B-2 by Moody's and B-minus
	by S and P were left unchanged on Friday.
	    The combined offering of 1.4 billion dlrs was the
	second-largest junk bond deal ever brought to market,
	underwriters and traders said. They said the biggest was BCI
	Holdings' 2.35 billion dlr offering on April 10, 1986.
	    That the Holiday Inns deal sold out quickly underscored the
	appetite of many investors for high-yield securities.
	    "People are hungry for yield. They are not worried about
	downside risk at all, especially for junk bonds issued by
	well-known companies," said one portfolio manager.
	    As a result, investors are expected to snap up this week's
	planned offerings by Allied Stores Corp of 200 mln dlrs of
	senior notes due 1992, rated B-2/B, and 600 mln dlrs of senior
	subordinated debentures due 1997, rated B-3/CCC-plus.
	    Lead underwriter First Boston Corp said Friday it has
	tentatively scheduled the securities for pricing today.
