	AWB CALLS FOR TIGHTER WHEAT QUALITY CONTROLS
TOPICS:
	grain, wheat
PLACES:
	australia
CONTENT:
	Australia is risking wheat export
	sales by not providing enough specific quality grades to meet
	buyer requirements, the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) said.
	    "Many AWB customers are becoming increasingly quality
	conscious, demanding strict adherence to contractual quality
	specifications," the board said in a submission to the Royal
	Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport.
	    "Many of the specifications are more specific than the
	current categories used in Australia," it said.
	    The commission is trying to identify ways of saving costs
	and boosting efficiency of the grain handling system.
	    Australia must rely on quality to retain its wheat market
	share because its competitors are supplying cheaper but
	lower-quality grades, the AWB submission said.
	    It stressed the need to segregate wheat categories at every
	stage from receival to shipping.
	    Better industrial relations at grain terminals, more
	uniform transport systems across the states and extensive stock
	control were vital to improved marketing, it said.
	    The submission also said Australia's federal system impeded
	the AWB's role of coordinating and managing the marketing of
	wheat.
	    The AWB called for an end to physical and legislative
	constraints at state borders that prevent the efficient
	transport of grains to other states for shipment.
	    "It is essential that wheat moves by the most economic mode
	to the nearest efficient port, irrespective of the state in
	which the wheat is grown or stored," it said.
	    For example, wheat grown in northern New South Wales (NSW)
	might move more efficiently to Brisbane, in Queensland, than to
	Sydney or Newcastle in New South Wales, it said. Similarly,
	southern NSW wheat might better be shipped to Portland or
	Geelong, in Victoria.
	    Legislation giving state rail authorities a monopoly over
	grain shipments was one notable impediment, it said.
	    The AWB said the current approach of state-based bulk
	handling authorities is not essential, although it said it
	favoured the authorities maintaining at least their current
	level of control of storage and transport as long as quality
	was maintained.
	    An appendix on port loading costs showed it cost between
	26,500 and 34,700 U.S. Dlrs to load a 50,000-tonne vessel at
	various Australian ports compared with 21,200 dlrs at Houston
	and 16,300 at Port Cartier, Quebec, for a 60,000-tonner.

	AWB SAYS AUSTRALIAN WHEAT SALES OVER 10 MLN TONNES
TOPICS:
	grain, wheat

CONTENT:
	The Australian Wheat Board's (AWB)
	1986/87 export program is well advanced with over 10 mln tonnes
	already sold, AWB general manager Ron Paice said.
	    "We are certainly within reach of our 15 mln tonne export
	target for the year," he said in a statement.
	    He did not detail the commitments already made, but an AWB
	spokesman said they include sales to Egypt, China, Iran, the
	Soviet Union and Iraq.
	    In the 1985/86 wheat year ended September 30, the AWB
	exported a record 15.96 mln tonnes.
	    Paice also said the 1986/87 Australian wheat harvest has
	ended after a long, cool summer with 15.14 mln tonnes delivered
	to the AWB.
	    The season produced another good crop, with only 0.2 pct of
	receivals being downgraded to feed quality, he said.
	    However, it is likely that some weather-damaged grain was
	still being held on farms and further milling and feed wheat
	may be delivered following the recent announcement of the final
	Guaranteed Minimum Price for 1986/87, he said.
	    Paice did not give a crop estimate, but the AWB's February
	Wheat Australia publication put the crop at 16.7 mln tonnes.
	    But the AWB spokesman said it is likely this estimate could
	turn out to be too high, based on the receivals level, and the
	final crop figure would probably be nearer to 16.2 mln tonnes.
	The official estimate is not yet available.
	    In the 1985/86 season, the AWB received 15.08 mln tonnes of
	the 16.13 mln tonne crop.
	    Another 422,000 tonnes was retained on-farm and 620,000
	sold under the permit system introduced in 1984/85 to allow
	farmers to sell feed wheat to the grain trade outside the AWB's
	receival system, according to Bureau of Agricultural Economics
	data.

	The Australian Wheat Board (AWB)
	expects to sell about 900,000 tonnes of wheat to the Japanese
	Food Agency this year after renewing its annual supply
	agreement, AWB general manager Ron Paice said.
	    Under the agreement, the AWB makes the wheat available and
	sells into the Food Agency's regular tenders, he said in a
	statement.
	    He noted that the Board has sold more than three mln tonnes
	to Japan in the past three years.

	AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT TO PAY SUBSIDIES--USDA
TOPICS:

	The Australian Government will likely
	reimburse the Australian Wheat Board, AWB, about 132 mln (U.S.)
	dlrs to pay wheat farmers for their 1986/87 crop, the U.S.
	Agriculture Department said.
	    In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains, the
	department said the sharp fall in world wheat prices has
	reduced the export sales revenue of the AWB to levels
	insufficient to cover its breakeven export price estimated at
	around 98 dlrs per tonne.
	     For example the recent large sales of wheat to China (1.5
	mln tonnes) and Egypt (2.0 mln tonnes) were well below the
	breakeven export price, it said.
	    Australian wheat farmers normally receive an advance
	payment known as the Guaranteed Minimum Price, GMP, calculated
	at 90 pct of the average of estimated returns in the current
	year and the two lowest of the previous three years, the
	department said.
	    In addition, deductions for taxes, freight, handling and
	storage are deducted from the GMP the farmer receives.
	    But the department said the Australian Bureau of
	Agricultural Economics, BAE, predicts wheat production will
	drop sharply from 17.8 mln tonnes in 1986/87 to 13.5 mln in
	1989/90.
	    The decline will result from low world grain prices leading
	to shifts to livestock and other crops which could benefit U.S.
	wheat exports, the department said.

	AWB CHAIRMAN URGES FARMERS NOT TO CUT PLANTINGS
TOPICS:
	grain, wheat
PLACES:
	australia
CONTENT:
	Australia could lose valuable wheat
	markets through lack of availability if plantings for the
	coming 1987/88 season are significantly reduced, Australian
	Wheat Board (AWB) chairman Clinton Condon said.
	    "If predictions of a 30 pct decrease in plantings prove
	true, Australia may not be able to supply wheat to some of its
	valuable markets," he said in a statement.
	    Condon did not say who had made the predictions, but an AWB
	spokesman said there was a general industry feeling that
	farmers, hard hit by low prices and rising costs, could cut
	back plantings sharply. Wheat sowing normally begins in May.
	    However, Condon said he did not believe plantings would be
	cut by as much as 30 pct although he realised many farmers were
	facing enormous financial pressures.
	    He said the AWB expects the area sown to be about 10.7 mln
	hectares, down from 11.3 mln in 1986/87 when the crop was about
	16 mln tonnes. Final crop estimates for 1986/87 and planting
	intentions for 1987/88 are not yet available.
	    If the AWB is unable, because of a short-term cut in
	plantings, to meet the needs of the markets it has developed
	with much time and effort, it may have great difficulty selling
	wheat to those markets in the future, Condon said.
	    "Markets which rely on a steady supply of Australian wheat
	understand a decrease in production due to drought but they
	will have difficulty understanding a deliberate decision to
	decrease production," Condon said.
	    "If Australia wants wheat to continue as a major export
	income earner, governments and government authorities will need
	to closely examine ways of contributing to the continuing
	viability of the wheat industry," he added.
	    Australia's leading wheat markets include China, Egypt,
	Iran, Iraq, the Soviet Union and Japan.

	OFFICIAL INQUIRY SET FOR AUSTRALIAN WHEAT INDUSTRY
TOPICS:
	grain, wheat
PLACES:
	australia
CONTENT:
	The government's industry aid and
	protection review body, the Industries Assistance Commission
	(IAC), will hold a 12-month inquiry into the Australian wheat
	industry, Primary Industry Minister John Kerin said.
	    The IAC has been asked to report on the need for assistance
	to the industry and the nature, duration and extent of any aid,
	he said in a statement.
	    He said the inquiry will be the first step in setting
	marketing arrangements to apply after June 30, 1989, when the
	underwriting and pricing provisions of the 1984 Wheat Marketing
	Act expire.
	    Kerin said the broad-ranging reference would allow a full
	examination of all aspects of the wheat-marketing system.
	    "The inquiry will be required to take into account changes
	which have taken place in the industry as a result of the
	agricultural policies of major wheat producing countries and
	the industry's capacity to adjust to any recommended changes,"
	he said.
	    "The inquiry is at an important time for the wheat industry,
	as the substantial fall in world prices is likely to trigger
	underwriting support from the government for the first time," he
	said.
	    Kerin was referring to the government's underwriting of the
	guaranteed minimum price paid to wheatgrowers by the Australian
	Wheat Board near the start of the season.
	    The IAC's report will be due at the same time as the
	findings of the current Royal Commission into Grain Storage,
	Handling and Transport, Kerin said.
	    He said the timing of the IAC inquiry would allow its
	findings and those of the Royal Commission to be considered in
	later negotiations on wheat-marketing arrangements between the
	federal and state governments and the industry.
