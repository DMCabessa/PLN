	U.S. CORN DEMAND GROWING IN JAPAN, SOUTH KOREA
TOPICS:

PLACES:
	usa, japan, south-korea
CONTENT:
	The recent purchase of 1.5 mln
	tonnes of U.S. corn by Japan and 600,000 tonnes by South Korea
	suggests that the two countries' demand for reliable supplies
	of corn is increasing, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
	    In its World Production and Trade Report, the department
	said that view is reinforced by the expectation of a decline in
	exportable supplies of Argentine corn and uncertainty over the
	availability of South African and Chinese corn.
	    With these corn purchases, Japan is committed to buying 7.7
	mln tonnes of U.S. corn in 1986/87 (Sept-Aug), nearly 400,000
	tonnes greater than year-ago figures to date.
	    South Korea's cumulative commitments amount to 2.5 mln
	tonnes, up 1.5 mln compared to last year, it said.

	ASIA TRYING TO FOSTER OIL EXPLORATION, SAYS U.N.

CONTENT:
	Asian countries are offering better oil
	exploration concessions to avert damaging shortfalls due to
	last year's oil price slump, the United Nations said.
	    The Bangkok-based U.N. Economic and Social Commission for
	Asia and the Pacific said in its annual report that the price
	fall substantially cut exploration by foreign oil firms, which
	found it unprofitable to maintain investments in the region.
	    Oil production investment in Indonesia fell to about 2.8
	billion dlrs in 1985 from 3.2 billion in 1983 and was estimated
	to have declined six pct last year. There were 11 wells drilled
	in Thailand in 1986 against 64 in 1985.
	    The report said <Thai Shell Exploration and Production Co
	Ltd>, a unit of the <Royal Dutch/Shell Group> announced a 30
	pct cut in exploration and production spending last year.
	    To counter declining output, India and Malaysia reduced
	petroleum sharing demands, while Indonesia cut taxes.
	    Nepal offered a guaranteed income share of up to 87.5 pct
	to cover exploration costs, while Thailand began decreasing its
	12.5 pct royalty payments. The big losers were major regional
	exporters such as Indonesia, Brunei, China, Malaysia and Iran.
	Their aggregate oil income fell an estimated 20 billion dlrs in
	1986 from 40 billion the previous year.
	    Indonesia's export earnings fell by nearly half in 1986
	from 11.6 billion dlrs in 1985, the U.N. Report said.
	    Iran also lost about six billion dlrs, Brunei 3.8 billion,
	China three billion and Malaysia 0.8 billion.
	    However, Asian importers saved between eight and nine
	billion dlrs during 1985 and 1986, which considerably eased
	their balance of payments.
	    South Korea, the Philippines, India, Thailand and Pakistan
	were major beneficiaries, with Thailand and Pakistan
	respectively saving about 875 mln and 435 mln dlrs last year.

	ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN PUSHES ITS CHIPMAKERS
TOPICS:
	trade
PLACES:
	usa, japan, south-korea
CONTENT:
	Japanese microchip makers are being
	strong-armed into compliance with a U.S.-Japan pact on
	semiconductors halting predatory pricing and opening Japan's
	market to foreign chips, industry analysts said.
	    But doubts remain over whether the Ministry of
	International Trade and Industry (MITI), which is pressuring
	the firms, can successfully battle market forces and whether
	the U.S. Industry is geared up to take advantage of any
	breathing space, they said.
	    U.S. Threats to scrap the agreement signed last September
	have pushed MITI to try harder to get recalcitrant Japanese
	chipmakers to abide by the pact, the analysts said.
	    "MITI has been moving hot and heavy throughout the industry
	to get things done," said Bache Securities (Japan) associate
	vice president Peter Wolffe.
	    Last month, MITI told chipmakers to cut production for the
	January to March period by 10 pct to help dry up inexpensive
	chips that have escaped from Japan to grey markets not subject
	to the pact's price controls.
	    The ministry also asked electronics firms to provide
	distributors with certificates designating them as authorised
	exporters, in an effort to close loopholes through which grey
	marketeers sneak chips out of Japan, market analysts said.
	    U.S. Trade negotiators here last week said the pact was in
	jeopardy because of continued dumping in non-American markets
	and little sign of increased foreign sales in Japan.
	    But major Japanese firms appear to have agreed to the
	production cuts, several analysts said. Last week, NEC Corp
	said it would cut production in line with MITI's request.
	    "NEC has been the most aggressive in resisting MITI's
	demands," said David Keller, analyst at James Capel and Co. "Once
	NEC cuts production, it means they all have."
	    Still, pressures remain to keep production high. Japanese
	firms need high output to cut unit prices for U.S. Sales that
	the Commerce Department assigns them under the pact.
	    "The best way to lower cost is to produce more," said Salomon
	Brothers Asia Ltd analyst Carole Ryavec.
	    Preparations for a possible upturn in demand could also
	spur higher production next quarter, Merrill Lynch analyst Matt
	Aizawa said.
	    Grey marketeers may also be able to outfox any new
	restrictions, some industry officials said.
	    "It's like tax avoidance schemes," said Steve Donovan, head
	of MMI Japan K.K. "As soon as you close one route, another
	opens."
	    MITI's pressure has annoyed some makers, who had earlier
	shrugged off MITI guidance.
	    "It's getting to be like communism," said one.
	    But analysts said output cuts could help by making it
	easier to increase prices as planned on April 1 and forcing
	firms to stop extending market share by selling at a loss.
	    "They're going to have to start running their businesses
	like businesses," Bache's Wolffe said.
	    MITI has also been conducting a highly public campaign
	urging chip users to buy foreign-made chips, but U.S. Industry
	officials said response has been mixed at best.
	    "There has been some change, but it's not across the board,"
	said one U.S. Spokesman. "The companies have a varying degree of
	urgency."
	    The ultimate impact of all these efforts by MITI on the
	troubled U.S. Industry remains in doubt, analysts added.
	    Pressure to cut production of 256 kilobit DRAM (dynamic
	random access memory) chips could merely speed the transition
	to one megabit chips, where Japan now leads, analysts said.
	    Whether U.S. Firms are able to stage a comeback in memory
	chips, or interested in doing so, also remains unclear, they
	said.
	    Analysts are watching with interest the fate of a new U.S.
	Consortium which hopes to challenge Japan by developing the
	most advanced technology for microchip manufacturing.
	    Even in the thorny area of access, much depends on U.S.
	Commitment as well as on Japanese openness, some said.
	    "The SIA (U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association) doesn't
	even have an office here," a source close to the industry said.
	"You could question just how committed they are."
	    In addition, some industry analysts question the
	effectiveness of a bilateral agreement that leaves out third
	country chipmakers such as those in South Korea.
	    "(South) Korea's gaining market share," said one analyst.
	"They're the real winners from the agreement."

	Corn sales gained 2,494,900 tonnes in
	the week ended February 26, the highest weekly total since
	August 1984 and two and three-quarter times the prior week's
	level, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
	    In comments on its Export Sales Report, the department said
	sales of 1.0 mln tonnes to the USSR -- previously reported
	under the daily reporting system -- were the first sales for
	delivery to the USSR under the fourth year of the U.S.-USSR
	Grains Supply Agreement, which began October 1.
	    Japan added 689,700 tonnes to previous purchases and sales
	to unknown destinations rose by 429,800 tonnes.
	    Wheat sales of 362,400 tonnes for the current season and
	151,000 for the 1987/88 season were down by more than half from
	the previous week's combined sales, it said.
	    Egypt, Japan and Iraq were the major wheat buyers for
	delivery in the current year, while sales to China decreased by
	30,000 tonnes for the current season, but increased by 90,000
	tonnes for the 1987/88 season, which begins June 1.
	    Net sales of soybeans totalling 274,200 tonnes equaled the
	preceding week, but were nearly a third below the four week
	average. Major increases were for Belgium, South Korea, Mexico
	and Italy, it said.
	    Soybean cake and meal sales of 103,700 tonnes were 2-3/4
	times the previous week's marketing year low, but six pct less
	than the four week average.
	    Major increases for West Germany, Belgium, Spain, Italy and
	Australia were partially offset by declines to unknown
	destinations.
	    Soybean oil sales of 5,400 tonnes were the result of
	increases for Venezuela and reductions of 500 tonnes for
	unknown destinations.
	    Combined sales activity in cotton of 75,200 running bales
	-- 44,700 bales for the current year and 30,500 bales for the
	1987/88  bales -- were 56 pct below the prior week's good
	showing, the department said.
	    Major purchasers for the current season were South Korea,
	Japan, Taiwan and Thailand, while South Korea and Indonesia
	were the major buyers for the 1987/88 season, which begins
	August 1.

	Brazil wants to increase its
	steel exports to the United States, now limited because of

	(IBS) said.
	    Brazilian and U.S. Trade officials held the first of a
	three-day meeting today in Brasilia to discuss the issue.
	    In 1984, after three months of painstaking negotiations,
	the U.S. Government reached accords with seven steel-exporting
	nations - Australia, Brazil, Japan, Mexico, Spain, South Africa
	and South Korea - to reduce their shipments to the United
	States by about 30 pct in 1985.
	    The 1984 restraints established that for 1987 Brazil's
	steel exports to the U.S. Could not exceed 632,000 tonnes,
	increasing to 640,000 tonnes in 1988 and 670,000 tonnes in
	1989, the last of the five-year deadline set by the agreements.
	    Brazilian officials are trying to increase Brazil's export

	BALDRIGE PRAISES NEW SOUTH KOREAN TRADE POLICIES
TOPICS:

CONTENT:
	U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige
	praised South Korea's new surplus-cutting trade policies but
	warned of possible protectionist retaliation if Seoul's market
	liberalisation efforts falter or fail.
	    In a press conference after talks with South Korean
	leaders, Baldrige called the government's announced intention
	to regulate exports and boost imports "a very, very important
	step, the right direction for the Korean government to take."
	    The government adopted the new policies last week in the
	hope of heading off a trade war with the U.S.
	    Baldrige said the policies "showed an understanding of the
	fact that this country cannot go on indefinitely growing by
	exports alone."
	    "There has to be enough of a change so that domestic growth
	begins to take more of the load," he said.
	    South Korea had a 7.2 billion dlr trade surplus with
	Washington in 1986, thanks largely to booming sales of cars and
	consumer electronic goods. It racked up another 1.4 billion
	dlrs in surplus in the first quarter of this year.
	    Baldrige said Seoul's package of measures was "broad enough
	and comprehensive enough so that ... Actions can be taken for
	liberalising imports (and) increasing the domestic economy, if
	the government is willing to follow through."
	    "We will be watching the implementation of this new policy
	direction very closely," he said. "Because of the protectionism
	growing in the U.S., We see a real problem if Korea does not
	keep on the same path ... Of steadily increasing
	liberalisation.... If that should falter or fail or turn
	backward, I'm as sure as I'm standing here that we'd see
	protectionist movement in the U.S."
	    Baldrige said he and South Korean Trade Minister Rha
	Woong-bae spent much time discussing trade problems in specific
	product categories.
	    These included service industries, which he said were still
	too much of a closed sector in South Korea, and computers and
	cars. Baldrige said he urged speedy action on removing the
	tariffs and taxes on imported U.S. Cars which can make them
	sell for up to three times their American prices.
	    "We want to stop that. With this sort of thing, there's
	going to be trouble somewhere down the road," he said. "We are
	just pointing this out."
	    Asked if Seoul's measures could succeed without a
	revaluation of the won, which Washington has been urging for
	months, Baldrige declined to comment. "We don't have any target
	for any particular currency, but we do feel that currencies
	around the world, if we are going to be successful as a world
	economy, have to reflect the fundamentals of the various
	economies involved," he said.
	    Baldrige said he had agreed to Rha's proposal for
	cooperation on forming U.S.-South Korean joint ventures in
	third countries. The American government would be pleased to
	encourage U.S. Firms to get involved, he added.
	    Commenting on President Reagan's decision to increase
	tariffs on certain Japanese imports to the U.S., Baldrige said
	Washington's trade problems with Japan were not comparable to
	its difficulties with South Korea.
	    "I think the attitude in Korea is both reasonable and fair,"
	he said. "It's a firm attitude. We don't get anything for
	nothing or just by asking for it.
	    "But our negotiations are friendly and reasonable and they
	usually end up with something good happening at the end that
	both countries live up to."

	GATT WARNS U.S. ON FEDERAL BUDGET, PROTECTIONISM
TOPICS:
	trade
PLACES:
	switzerland, usa, west-germany, japan
CONTENT:
	The United States' emphasis on its
	foreign trade deficit is misplaced and the country's real
	problem lies in its large federal budget deficit, the General
	Agreeement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) said.
	     By stressing its record trade deficit of 169.8 billion
	dlrs last year, the U.S. Was fuelling protectionist pressure
	which threatens the world trading system, it said in an annual
	report.
	    The fundamental problem, the size of the U.S. Federal
	budget deficit, could be remedied only by cutting government
	spending or encouraging personal savings to finance the debt,
	it said.
	    GATT also predicted world trade would grow by only 2.5 pct
	in 1987 -- a full percentage point lower than in each of the
	previous two years.
	    GATT experts urged Washington to resist protectionism and
	instead seek macroeconomic changes to reduce the current
	account payments deficit -- higher private savings, lower
	investment and a smaller federal budget deficit.
	    Raising U.S. Trade barriers "would result in little or no
	reduction in the current account deficit. It would, however,
	increase inflation and reduce world trade," it said.
	    "The basic cause -- some combination of insufficient
	domestic savings and an excessive budget deficit -- would
	remain," the report said.
	    GATT economists said trade expansion would slow this year
	because of slower growth forecasts in Japan and some West
	European nations as they adjust production and workforces to a
	low dollar, risk of higher U.S. Inflation, concerns over Third
	World debt management and looming protectionism.
	    The report also said imbalances in the current accounts of
	Japan, West Germany and the U.S. Had increased in 1986.
	    The most likely explanation was that exchange rate changes
	were not backed by changes in macroeconomic policies, it added.
	    "Thus the prediction that these imbalances would be reduced
	as a result of the major realignment of exchange rates was not
	borne out last year," the report said.
	    GATT warned there was a risk of a sizeable increase in the
	U.S. Inflation rate under the combined impact of a rapidly
	expanding money supply and low dollar.
	    "Such a development could worsen the business climate by
	increasing uncertainty and pushing up interest rates, which, in
	turn, would adversely affect world trade."
	    But the report noted a surprising rise in imports to the
	United States, despite the dollar's depreciation which makes
	foreign products more expensive.
	    It suggested that resources idle in the U.S., Both human
	and in underutilised factories, were not geared to produce the
	goods and services sought from abroad.
	    World trade in manufactures grew by only three pct in 1986,
	about half of the rate of the previous year.
	    Trade in agricultural goods expanded by just one pct,
	continuing a stagnant pattern in that sector this decade, GATT
	said.
	    Developing countries' exports declined significantly, while
	their imports increased moderately, although full statistics
	are not available yet, GATT said.
	    The combined export earnings of 16 major indebted nations
	were sharply lower, and only five of them (Chile, Colombia,
	Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand) had higher exports.

	quarter were up 2.7 billion dlrs or three pct to 87.7 billion
	dlrs, with the largest increases in consumer goods, which rose
	1.2 billion dlrs, and in non-monetary gold and passenger cars
	from Canada, up 900 mln dlrs each.
	    Lumber imports from Canada fell 300 mln dlrs or 33 pct
	because of a 15 pct duty on imports from Canada, the department
	said. Passenger car imports fell 600 mln dlrs because of an 18
	pct decrease in the number of South Korean-made imported cars
	and a nine pct decrease from Japan.
	    On the exports side, agricultural exports rose 600 mln dlrs
	or nine pct to 7.1 billion dlrs, primarily because of a 104 pct
	or 600 mln dlr increase in soybean exports.
	    Soybean shipments to Western Europe rose sharply because
	supplies from Brazil, a traditional major exporter, were
	limited by drought.
	    Commerce said the U.S. trade deficit with Latin America
	rose 900 mln dlrs to 2.6 billion dlrs, with Japan increased 700
	mln dlrs to 14.8 billion dlrs and with Western Europe rose 200
	mln to 7.2 billion dlrs in the quarter.
	    The deficit with newly industrialized Far East countries,
	including Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan, fell
	500 mln dlrs to eight billion dlrs and with Canada the deficit
	decreased 200 mln dlrs to 3.3 billion dlrs in the quarter.
	    In the full year 1986, imports rose 30.6 billion dlrs or
	nine pct to 369.5 billion dlrs. Exports increased by only 7.3
	billion dlrs or three pct to 221.8 billion dlrs.
	    Commerce said petroleum imports during 1986 fell 16.6
	billion dlrs or 33 pct to 33.9 billion dlrs because of lower
	prices. The average price per barrel decreased to 14.72 dlrs
	from 26.41 dlrs.
	    Agricultural exports fell by 2.6 billion dlrs or nine pct
	to 26.9 billion during the year. The average price of rice fell
	27 pct, cotton was down 22 pct, corn 18 pct, wheat 16 pct and
	soybeans nine pct.
	    The trade deficit with Japan for all of 1986 rose 11.1
	billion dlrs to 54.6 billion dlrs and with Western Europe
	increased 7.2 billion dlrs to 28.6 billion dlrs.

	JAPANESE TARIFFS SEEN AS WORLDWIDE WARNING
TOPICS:
	trade
PLACES:
	usa, japan, taiwan, south-korea
CONTENT:
	The tough trade sanctions President
	Reagan imposed on Japanese exports are not only a shot across
	Japan's bow but also a sign Reagan will attack unfair trade
	practices worldwide, U.S. officials said.
	    But Robert Crandall, a trade specialist at Brookings
	Institution, a think tank, said "a shot across their bow can
	often result in a shot in our stern."
	    He said it left the United States open to retaliation.
	    The U.S. officials said the 100 pct tariffs Reagan ordered
	on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods will also show Congress
	that a tough pro-trade stand can be taken under existing laws,
	and no new protectionist legislation is needed.
	    In the past year tough trade action had been taken against
	the European Community over corn and sorghum, Taiwan over beer
	and wine, South Korea over counterfeiting of copyrights,
	patents and trademarkets and Japan on tobacco.
	    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters the
	tariffs - up from five pct - should be seen as a "serious signal"
	to other nations on the need for fair trade practices.
	    Reagan said he imposed the sanctions on certain computers,
	television sets and some hand tools because Japan did not honor
	an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at
	less than cost and to open its markets to U.S. products. The
	tariffs were placed on items which were available from other
	sources so there would be little effect on the American
	consumer, Fitzwater said.
	    Reagan has come under heavy pressure to take tougher action
	- especially against Japan - to end global unfair trade
	practices and reverse the growing U.S. trade deficit.
	    The alternative was that if he did not, Congress would.
	    The U.S. trade gap last year was a record 169.8 billion
	dlrs, and continues to rise, with Japan accounting for about
	one-third of America's overall deficit.
	    But there are other two-way deficits - with Canada, West
	Germany, Taiwan and South Korea - and Reagan officials said the
	president is ready to fight them all.
	    Reagan said in announcing the sanctions today that "I regret
	that these actions are necessary," but that the health and
	vitality of the U.S. semiconductor industry was essential to
	American competitiveness in world markets.
	    "We cannot allow it to be jeopardized by unfair trading
	practices," Reagan added in the statement from his California
	vacation home at Santa Barbara.
	    He said the tariffs would remain in force until Japan
	abided by the agreement.
	    U.S. officials say the action today will show Congress -
	which is about to write a trade bill he does not like - that he
	already has the tools needed to fight unfair trade.
	    The White House aide said of the tariff action, "it wasn't
	done to appease Congress, but because there was an unfair trade
	practice."
	    The aide added, however, "on another plane, it was an
	example of how the administration uses the trade law to fight
	unfair practices, an that it is not necessary to make a major
	overall of our trade laws."
	    But the analyst, Crandall, said the tariff action was not
	in the best interests of the United States, and that
	negotiations should have been pursued to resolve the issue.
	    "It's very dangerous to go down the retaliatory route," he
	said, "because it leads to more retaliation and restrictions in
	trade."
	    Crandall said, "the administration is doing this for its
	political impact across the country, and therefore its impact
	on Congress."
	    He said, "I don't think it makes a lot of sense."
	    But other analysts said it made little difference whether
	the tariffs were aimed at U.S. trading partners or Congress,
	and that the main point was that the trading partners were on
	notice that retaliation was a weapon Reagan was ready to use.
	    Spokesman Fitzwater said "we don't want a trade war," but the
	imposition of sanctions showed the United States would act when
	it had evidence that trade pacts were being violated.

	REPORT EXPECTS SHARP DROP IN WORLD IRON IMPORTS

CONTENT:
	World seaborne iron ore imports will
	fall sharply by the year 2000 with declining imports to the EC
	and Japan only partially offset by increased demand from South
	East Asia, a report by Ocean Shipping Consultants said.
	    The report predicts annual world seaborne iron ore imports
	of 267.7 mln tonnes by 2000 versus 312.4 mln tonnes in 1985.
	    It estimates that total bulk shipping demand from the iron
	ore sector will fall by almost 10 pct, or 200 billion tonne
	miles, with shipping demand associated with the coking trade
	down about 17 pct or 130 billion tonne miles.
	    The report sees EC imports falling to 91.7 mln tonnes in
	2000 from 123.6 mln in 1985 with Japanese imports falling to 89
	mln from 124.6 mln tonnes. Imports to South East Asia are seen
	rising to 58.6 mln from 32.6 mln tonnes in 1985.
	    It predicts that EC steel production will fall to 109 mln
	tonnes in 2000 from 135.7 mln in 1985 with Japanese production
	falling to 92 mln from 105.3 mln.
	    South Korea and Taiwan are expected to double their output
	to 40 mln tonnes with Chinese production increasing by 25 mln
	tonnes to 80 mln, it added.

	Corn sales of 2,806,300 tonnes in
	the week ended March 19 were the highest level since
	mid-November, 1979, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
	    The department said the USSR dominated the week's activity
	with purchases of 1.4 mln tonnes (which were earlier reported
	under the daily reporting system). Other large increaes were
	posted for Japan and unknown destinations, it said.
	    Taiwan purchased 296,300 tonnes for the 1986/87 season and
	170,000 tonnes for the 1987/88 season, it said.
	    Wheat sales of 317,200 tonnes for the current season and
	125,000 tonnes for the 1987/88 season were down about one-third
	from the preceding week and the four-week average.
	    Wheat sales to China of 60,000 tonnes were switched from
	1986/87 to the 1987/88 season, it noted.
	    Soybean sales of 483,100 tonnes were 11 pct above the prior
	week and two-thirds above the four-week average.
	    Japan, the Netherlands, Mexico and Portugal were the main
	buyers, the department said.
	    Soybean cake and meal sales of 289,400 tonnes were
	two-thirds above the previous week and the largest of the
	marketing year, with Venezuela the dominant purchaser.
	    Sales activity in soybean oil resulted in decreases of
	4,400 tonnes, as reductions for unknown destinations more than
	offset increases for Canada, the Dominican Republic and Panama,
	the department said.
	    Cotton sales of 57,900 running bales -- 43,800 bales for
	the current year and 14,200 bales for the 1987/88 season --
	were off 25 pct from the previous week and 50 pct from the
	four-week average.
	    Turkey, Thailand, South Korea and Canada were the major
	buyers for the current season, while Thailand, Britain and
	Japan were the major purchasers from the upcoming season, the
	department said.
	     Sorghum sales of 178,800 tonnes were two-thirds above the
	prior week and 75 pct over the four-week average.
	    Venezuela was the leading buyer it said.
	    Sales of 41,800 tonnes of barley were 10 times the previous

	South Korea's purchase of about 2.4
	mln tonnes of U.S. corn in the past six months -- close to
	double last year's total -- indicates that imports from the
	United States, as well as total imports are set for a dramatic
	jump, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
	    In its World Production and Trade Report, the department
	said total South Korea corn imports for the 1986/87 season
	(Oct-Sept) are estimated at 4.3 mln tonnes, with about 3.4 mln
	tonnes from the United States.
	    During the 1985/86 season, imports totaled only 1.3 mln
	tonnes of U.S. corn out of a total of 3.6 mln tonnes.
	    Ite appears the Koreans are shifting back to U.S. corn in
	light of competitive U.S. prices and uncertain supplies from
	China, Argentina and South Africa, it said.
