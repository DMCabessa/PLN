	Venezuelan Central Bank President Hernan
	Anzola has submitted his resignation and asked President Jaime
	Lusinchi to transfer him to a post in the oil industry, two
	leading Venezuelan newspapers reported.
	    The El Universal and El Nacional papers said Anzola would
	leave his position soon. Lusinchi already has decided on his
	successor, the El Nacional reported.
	    Central Bank officials were not available for comment.
	
	    Banking sources said Anzola differed with the Finance
	Ministry over economic policy, particularly over the direction
	of interest rates. He favoured raising the rates, which are
	currently well below the annual inflation rate of 33.2 pct.
	    But the sources said he ran into opposition from Finance
	Ministry and government officials who thought an interest
	increase would fuel inflation.

	ECUADOR TO EXPORT NO OIL FOR FOUR MONTHS, OFFICIAL

	The suspension of Ecuador's crude oil
	shipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at
	least four months, a senior Energy Ministry official said.
	    The official said Ecuador could resume exports after
	repairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which links
	jungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast.
	It would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline,
	the official, who did not want to be named, told Reuters.
	Ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35
	days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks.
	    The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the
	12-point international Mercalli scale. The damage to the
	pipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador, where oil
	accounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as
	60 pct of government revenues.
	    Financially pressed Ecuador, a member of the Organisation
	of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was recently pumping
	about 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, about 50,000 bpd
	above the output quota assigned by the cartel, another Energy
	Ministry spokesman said. Last year, it exported an average of
	173,500 bpd, according to the central bank.
	    However, Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline,
	costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs, to hook up with a Colombian
	pipeline, the first official said. He estimated it could take
	about 60 days to build.
	    Ecuador, squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986,
	had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the end
	of January, about equal to one month's imports.
	    It suspended interest payments in January on 5.4 billion
	dlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks. The country's
	total foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs, the eighth largest in
	Latin America.
	    In Caracas, President Jaime Lusinchi said Venezuela would
	loan five mln barrels of crude to Ecuador over the next three
	months to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline.
	    Ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic supplies
	and would ship an equivalent volume back to Venezuela in
	repayment in May, Lusinchi said.
	    A commission headed by Venezuelan Investment Fund Minister
	Hector Hurtado and including representatives from the interior
	and defence ministries and the state oil company Petroleos de
	Venezuela will travel to Ecuador Tuesday to evaluate and
	co-ordinate an emergency relief program, he said.

	VENEZUELA APPROVES WAGE INCREASES, PRICE CONTROLS

CONTENT:
	Venezuelan president Jaime Lusinchi
	approved a general wage increase in the form of bonuses ranging
	from 20 to 30 pct and a 120-day price freeze on a basket of
	basic consumer goods.
	    Both measures, which take effect on May 1, were approved by
	the cabinet. They will be announced to the nation by Lusinchi
	in a televised address tonight but the text of the decrees was
	released this afternoon.
	    Businessmen, who met Lusinchi, opposed the pay rise, saying
	it will fuel inflation. The inflation rate was 11.5 pct in 1986
	and private economists say it will be 25 to 30 pct in 1987.
	    The central bank said first quarter inflation was 6.3 pct.
	    The wage increase for public and private sector employees
	will be 30 pct on salaries of up to 2,100 bolivars a month. For
	salaries of from 2,101 to 6,100 bolivars 25 pct and for those
	of 6,101 to 20,000 bolivars 20 pct.
	    The measures were taken in response to a request from the
	Venezuelan confederation CTV for an increase to offset the loss
	in the purchasing power of workers' salaries. It estimated the
	loss at 40 pct.
	    The general wage rise is the third granted by Lusinchi
	since his government took office in February 1984.
	    The wage increases are a bonus and will not be considered
	in calculating benefits or severance pay, the decree said.
	    At the same time, Lusinchi declared a freeze on lay-offs
	and firings for the next 120 days.
	    The price freeze applies to a group of 120 foods and other
	consumer goods declared to be "of primary necessity."
	    It does not apply to prices charged by agricultural
	producers or to goods for which the price is falling.
	    The decree establishes fines of between 1,000 and 500,000
	bolivars for merchants who violate the price control measure.

	VENEZUELA TIGHTENS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS
TOPICS:

CONTENT:
	Venezuela's central bank has ordered
	Venezuelan banks and exchange houses to cease foreign exchange
	operations with brokers based outside the country, according to
	a copy of a central bank telex made available to Reuters.
	    The measure, confirmed by a brokerage firm here, has
	effectively cut off all foreign participation in Venezuela's
	volatile currency market.
	    The telex, issued on May 19, was signed by Carlos Hernandez
	Delfino, manager of the bank's department of international
	operations.
	    The telex said the restriction on business with foreign
	brokers is in line with an earlier measure prohibiting foreign
	exchange houses from selling dollars or other foreign
	currencies to anyone living outside Venezuela.
	    In recent weeks the Venezuelan government has denied
	rumours that it intends to impose foreign exchange controls to
	prop up the weakening bolivar.
	    But brokers said the central bank's move is seen as a de
	facto currency control. "It is definitely a control in the sense
	that there's no longer complete freedom to operate," one broker
	here said.
	    "Gradually they're imposing restrictions and the direction
	is towards complete control," the broker said.
	    The broker, who requested anonymity, said virtually all his
	Venezuelan customers had stopped doing business with him since
	the central bank issued the telex and followed it up with
	telephone calls.
	    He said that before the restriction was imposed the volume
	of his firm's transactions with Venezuela was about 10 mln dlrs
	a day. "It was a frenetic market, it was really quite active," he
	said.
	    The broker said he saw no logical explanation for the
	prohibition because his firm only acted act as an intermediary
	between Venezuelan brokers, exchange houses and banks.
	    "We weren't buying dollars from Venezuelans, that's
	ridiculous," he said. "They've been on a rampage against
	foreigners."
	    The broker noted that two months ago Venezuela's central
	bank quietly announced that banks doing foreign exchange
	business outside Venezuela would have to respect a new 200 pct
	reserve requirement.
	    In February, the central bank also prohibited trading in
	bolivar futures, the broker said.
	    "We used to have a forward market," he said. "For a small
	currency it was miraculous."
	    He said the bolivar, which averaged 20.29 to the U.S.
	Dollar in 1986, would continue to slip from its current range
	of 28.35 to 28.50 because the central bank was rapidly running
	out of foreign reserves to support the currency on the free
	market.

	Brazil is preparing a new economic
	strategy intended to protect domestic growth, Finance Ministry
	sources said.
	    A presidential spokesman said President Jose Sarney had
	authorised the government's economic team to prepare the new
	plan as soon as possible.
	    Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said last night the plan
	would reflect "an important battle to protect the country's
	development and keep it from recession."
	    Funaro, who helped lead the anti-inflation Cruzado Plan
	launched in February 1986, has come under increasing attack
	over the past few days following the resignation of Planning
	Minister Joao Sayad on March 17. Observers say the plan has
	failed to stabilise the country's economy.
	    Sayad submitted a new package calling for a 90-day prices
	and a wage freeze, but met opposition from Sarney and Funaro.
	    Foreign Ministry sources said the new strategy was being
	prepared by economists Persio Arida and Andre Lara Resende,
	both former Central Bank officials said to have played leading
	roles in the Cruzado Plan.
	   The new plan will define the terms on which Brazil will seek
	rescheduling of its 109 billion dlr foreign debt.
	    On February 20, Brazil suspended servicing of 70 billion
	dlrs of debt to private foreign banks.
	    Funaro said last night Brazil wants a rescheduling program
	spread over four years, and added that it had to include new
	loans to keep the domestic economy growing.
	    "In the past two years Brazil paid 24 billion dlrs in
	servicing of its foreign debt, while only getting two billion
	dlrs in new loans," Funaro said.

	Venezuela seeks 'flexibility' from banks-azpurua

CONTENT:
	venezuela is seeking a 'constructive and
	flexible' attitude from its creditor banks in current talks to
	reschedule 21 billion dlrs in foreign debt, finance minister
	manuel azpurua told a press conference.
	    He declined to comment on meetings this week in new york
	between public finances director jorge marcano and venezuela's
	13-bank advisory committee except to say, "they are
	progressing."
	    Azpurua said venezuela has shown solidarity with brazil's
	decision to suspend payments, but each country must negotiate
	according to its own interest.
	    Asked to comment on chile's agreement with its creditors
	today, which includes an interest rate margin of one pct over
	libor, azpurua said only, "that is good news."
	    According to banking sources, the banks' latest offer to
	venezuela is also a one pct margin as against the last
	february's 1-1/8 pct rescheduling accord and the 7/8 pct
	Venezuela wants.
	    Azpurua said four basic elements are being negotiated with
	the banks now: spread reduction, deferral of principal payments
	due in 1987 and 1988, lenghtening the 12-1/2 year repayment
	schedule, and debt capitalization schemes.
	    Azpurua said the governent plans to pay 2.1 billion dlrs in
	public and private debt principal this year. It was due to
	amortize 1.05 billion dlrs under the rescheduling, and pay 420
	mln dlrs in non-restructured principal, both public sector.
	    He said venezuela's original proposal was to pay no
	principal on restructured debt this year, but is now insisting
	that if it makes payments they be compensated by new bank
	loans.
	    The banking sources said the committee has been prepared to
	lower amortizations to around 400 mln dlrs this year, but that
	no direct commitment was likely on new loans.
	    "debtors and bank creditors have a joint responsibility and
	there will be no lasting solution unless a positive flow of
	financing is guaranteed," azpurua said.
	    However, he appeared to discard earlier venezuelan
	proposals for a direct link between oil income and debt
	payments, "because circumstances change too quickly."
	    At the same time, he said the government is presently
	studying possible mechanisms for capitlizing public and private
	sector foreign debt, based on experience in other countries.
	The rules would be published by the finance ministry and the
	central bank.

	FUNARO'S DEPARTURE COULD LEAD TO BRAZIL DEBT DEAL
TOPICS:
	
PLACES:
	brazil
CONTENT:
	The resignation of Finance Minister
	Dilson Funaro is bound to focus attention on whether Brazil
	will now adopt a more flexible debt stance and move towards an
	accord with creditors, bankers and political analysts said.
	    With Funaro in charge, Brazil's relations with creditors
	sank to a low ebb, they said.
	    Bankers told anti-Funaro jokes from Sao Paulo to New York
	and economic analysts said the personal animosity between the
	minister and U.S. Bankers was a real obstacle to reaching
	agreement on rescheduling Brazil's 111 billion dlr debt.
	    Commenting on Funaro, a foreign banker here recently told
	Reuters, "They (banks) see his removal pretty much as a
	precondition for getting serious negotiations under way."
	    Funaro angered the banks in February by suspending interest
	payment on Brazil's 68 billion dlr bank debt.
	    There was also a question of personal style. Bankers
	disliked Funaro's aloof demeanor and in private heatedly
	accused him of arrogance and inflexibility.
	    However, Funaro did not fall because he upset foreign
	bankers but rather because his Cruzado Plan price freeze last
	year was a massive flop, economically and politically.
	    However, it is in the domain of the debt and Brazil's
	relation with creditors that his departure will have the most
	closely-watched international repercussion, bankers said.
	    It became part of Funaro's trademark that he would have no
	truck with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), thus
	effectively blocking a debt agreement.
	    He argued that if Brazil sought the help of the IMF, the
	Fund would lay down conditions which would lead to recession.
	    Funaro and others who supported this position had memories
	of the IMF austerity program in Brazil in the early 1980s, a
	period when hungry crowds stormed supermarkets.
	    The foreign banker in Sao Paulo said, "I think Brazil could
	have an agreement with the IMF which would allow (it)
	acceptable growth."
	    Argentina, working with the IMF, won excellent terms for a
	major portion of its 50 billion dlr debt earlier this month.
	    Given the IMF role in the Argentine accord, a U.S. Diplomat
	here said the agreement had been extremely damaging for Funaro
	because it showed that cooperation with the IMF bore fruit.
	    Mexico has also taken the IMF path and, earlier than
	Argentina, clinched a favourable pioneering agreement with
	creditors on its 100 billion dlr debt.
	    Brazil is now the only one of the three biggest Latin
	American debtors not to have a debt agreement.
	    Some Brazilian opinion, particularly in the business
	community, is favourable to an IMF accord.
	    A leading newspaper, Jornal do Brazil, carried a report
	from Washington over the weekend saying it was a myth the IMF
	brought recession and the best moment for an accord was now. As
	it happens, a routine IMF mission is visiting Brasilia.
	    The government has repeatedly dismissed speculation it is
	considering any major change in debt policy and political
	analysts caution against expecting changes on the IMF issue.
	    The government of President Jose Sarney has gained a
	reputation for chronic indecisiveness and some analysts believe
	the government will turn to the IMF only if it comes to the
	conclusion there really is no option.
	    But such a policy shift looks more and more likely before
	too long in the eyes of many analysts.
	    One major political obstacle, Funaro, is no longer in the
	picture and the economic pressures on Brazil are growing.
	    The sharp drop in the trade surplus, which triggered
	Brazil's present debt crisis, shows no sign of being reversed.
	In the first quarter of 1987 Brazil chalked up a surplus of
	only 526 mln dlrs, just a fraction of the 2.47 billion dlr
	surplus it had in the same period last year.
	    Brazilian officials concede that time is not on their side
	in the debt crisis.
	    "Brazil has an interest in resolving this problem as rapidly
	as possible," Central Bank President Francisco Gros said on
	Friday.

	venezuela will shortly announce a new
	plan to allow private companies to repay their foreign debts
	with equity and for public debt to be converted into private
	sector investments, cntral bank president hernan anzola said.
	    Anzola told a meeting of the banking association yesterday
	the new plan, to be called exchange agreement no. 4, will be
	announced in mid-april.
	    He said it will allow foreign creditors to convert unpaid
	private sector debts into bolivar-denominated shares of stock
	in the debtor companies. the plan would be similar to those
	already in effect in other latin american nations, he said.
	    at least a half dozen such debt-equity swaps have already
	taken place in venezuela. In 1984, a group of 17 U.S. Banks led
	by citibank converted 18.3 mln dlrs of debt from the cervecera
	nacional, into 30 pct of the beer company'stock.
	    Anzola said exchange agreement no. 4 will also allow for
	conversion of public sector debt into investments in venezuelan
	private industry.
	    Holders of venezuelan public debt bonds would be able to
	exchange them for bolivar-denominated bonds at up to 100 pct of
	their nominal value, which could be turned into private
	investment in priority areas.
	    This, anzola said, would mean a reduction in the amount of
	the public sector debt and an increase in foreign investment.
	He stressed that the public sector debt bonds will not be
	exchanged for shares of stock in state-owned companies.
	    Anzola said exchange rates for these transactions will
	depend the type of investment the creditor intends to make,
	with export-oriented companies to be favored.
	    Venezuela issued a new plan in december for the repayment
	of 7.8 billion dlrs in private sector foreign debt. Under the
	scheme, debtors are able to buy dollars at the preferential
	7.50 bolivars rate, but must also pay a premium.

	VOLCKER LEAVES VOID ON LDC DEBT, BANKERS SAY

CONTENT:
	Paul Volcker's resignation as Federal
	Reserve Board chairman creates a serious leadership vacuum at a
	time of deep uncertainty about the future management of the
	third-world debt crisis, bankers said.
	    They said Volcker did more than any other official to hold
	the financial system together when Mexico halted interest
	payments in August 1982 and has played a central role ever
	since.
	    "Where is the leadership going to come from? Suddenly
	there's a terrible void," one New York banker said.
	    Volcker's expertise will be all the more sorely missed
	because International Monetary Fund managing director Michel
	Camdessus is new to his job and Barber Conable is finding it
	hard to make a mark as World Bank president, bankers said.
	    Moreover, Volcker's successor, Alan Greenspan, has little
	experience of international affairs and third world debt.
	    "Greenspan does not have the sensitivity to these issues
	and the sense of understanding of their complexity that Volcker
	has. Volcker understands what motivates people outside the U.S.
	That was in his gut. Greenspan just does not have the intuitive
	feeling," one banker said.
	    This banker, who has discussed debt questions with
	Greenspan, described his views as simplistic.
	    But Robert Hormats of Goldman, Sachs and Co said he was not
	worried by Greenspan's lack of international experience.
	    "People rush to judgment, but once they get to know
	Greenspan I'm sure they'll find him an excellent replacement,"
	said Hormats, a former Administration official.
	    Anyone nominated to replace Volcker would have paled in the
	initial comparison, Hormats said. "Volcker had the status of a
	financial demigod and you can't attain that status overnight,"
	he said.
	    One veteran debt rescheduler said Volcker, together with
	the Bank of England, deserves credit for keeping the banking
	system intact after Mexico's default.
	    "If it hadn't been for him, the world would look a lot
	different now," he said. "Whether you agreed with him or not,
	he has a superb grasp of ideas."
	    Certainly, not all bankers did agree all the time with
	Volcker. In particular, he was roundly criticized by some for
	more or less forcing them last September to grant Mexico
	generous terms on its 77 billion dlr new-loan and debt
	rescheduling agreement.
	    "Volcker lost a lot of credibility by overstepping the
	bounds and pushing the package onto the banks," commented one
	banker who helped to negotiate the Mexican deal.
	    Another critic was Citicorp chairman John Reed, who said
	the 13/16 pct interest margin would deter some bank lenders and
	thus delay Mexico's return to the voluntary markets.
	    It was a review of the fate of the Mexican deal - and of
	others that followed it for Chile, Venezuela, the Philippines
	and Argentina - that helped to convince Reed that the debt
	crisis was not about to be solved and that Citicorp needed to
	bolster its reserves in case some of the loans went bad.
	    "It certainly contributed to the general feeling of
	malaise," one Citicorp banker said in describing the impact of
	the Mexican package on the bank's decision to add three billion
	dlrs to its reserve for possible loan losses.
	    That decision, since followed by Chase Manhattan and
	Security Pacific Corp, may profoundly alter the strategy of
	creditors and debtors alike for tackling the debt crisis.
	    But no one is sure what the impact will be. "It's very
	difficult for anyone to know which way the debt problem is
	going, and with Volcker out of the picture it just adds to the
	uncertainty," one banker said.

	VOLCKER LEAVING DESPITE REAGAN REQUESTS TO STAY
TOPICS:

CONTENT:
	Paul Volcker's departure as Federal
	Reserve Board chairman came despite pleas from the Reagan
	administration that he stay at the helm of the U.S. central
	bank, U.S. officials said.
	    "The President made it very clear that he would be very,
	very pleased had the chairman's decision been otherwise,"
	Treasury Secretary James Baker said.
	    A Reagan administration official, who asked not to be
	identified, said Baker too had urged Volcker repeatedly in the
	past several months to consider staying on as chairman.
	    But there were no indications the administration had told
	Volcker that it was in the national interest for him to stay
	and that current global economic uncertainties required it.
	    Associates of Volcker have assumed Volcker would only have
	stayed on in such circumstances. "He doesn't care a lot,
	emotionally, about a third term," Nikko Securities vice-chairman
	Stephen Alixrod, until last year a top Fed staffer, told
	Reuters recently.
	    Officials are confident that newly-nominated chairman Alan
	Greenspan will re-establish close working relations with Baker
	and his credentials eventually will calm markets.
	    One Reagan administration economic policymaker, who asked
	not to be named, pointed out that Baker and Greenspan worked
	together closely in the Ford administration.
	    At the time, Baker was acting Secretary of Commerce and
	Greenspan headed the President's Council of Economic Advisers.
	    Reagan administration officials made clear, meanwhile, that
	the announcement, precipitated by Volcker's unshakeable
	decision to quit, came in order to clear up uncertainty ahead
	of the Summit of leading industrial democracies in Venice.
	    President Reagan might have been in an embarrassing
	position if no decision had been made by then.
	    Volcker enjoys the respect of most top economic officials
	abroad, and is admired at the West German Bundesbank, and in
	Tokyo, despite his criticism  of Japanese policies.
	    Financial markets, possibly reflecting some of the
	disappointment in foreign capitals, drove the dollar sharply
	lower on news of his departure, prompting central bank
	intervention to stem the fall, dealers said.
	    Finance Ministries and central banks of the other summit
	nations -- Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and
	Canada -- were informed shortly before the news was announced,
	Baker told reporters today.
	    Monetary sources also said one reason Volcker decided to
	resign was his personal financial situation and his marriage 
	-- his wife lives in New York and did not want him to take up a
	second term in mid-1983.
	    Volcker has foregone potentially million-dollar salaries to
	a life almost overwhelmingly devoted to public service at pay
	rates low relative to his financial commitments.
	    Both these reasons at one time prompted him to consider
	stepping down before his second term was completed.
	    But Volcker also hinted there might be more than personal
	reasons for his decision. "It was a personal decision, taking
	account of a lot of things, including purely personal
	considerations and others," he told reporters.
	    Fed sources note Volcker's considerable unease at the lack
	of progress by the administration in reaching a budget deficit
	reduction agreement.
	    In addition, Volcker would have faced four more years with
	a Board that he was less than comfortable with, monetary
	sources say. The other five members are Reagan appointees.
	    What may unsettle markets, however, is the fact that the
	Fed governors now have only six to seven years' collective
	experience between them, at a time of great financial
	uncertainty.
	    Analysts said that while Greenspan might well be considered
	as tough an inflation-fighter as Volcker, his Republican
	credentials could make him more of a political Fed chairman
	than Volcker.
	    An administration official said Volcker was consulted on
	Greenspan "and very much approved of his replacement."
	    But one analyst compared Greenspan's relationship to the
	administration, to whom he has been an unofficial economic
	adviser, with the relationship former chairman Arthur Burns had
	with the Nixon administration.
	    Burns was somewhat more sympathetic to the administration
	viewpoint than Volcker has been, and Burns was less willing to
	make radical policy changes.
	    Making clear his decision was a strong one, Volcker told
	reporters, "I told (Reagan) with considerable definitiveness
	yesterday." Administration officials said Volcker arrived at the
	White House yesterday afternoon with his resignation.
	    When renominated in mid-1983, Volcker said he would
	probably step down within two years. Monetary sources said the
	departure of Donald Regan as Treasury Secretary was one factor
	that convinced him to stay on. Regan and Volcker clashed almost
	from the start of the administration.
	    Another, these sources said, was the prospect of being able
	to work with Baker as Treasury Secretary to tackle the
	international debt crisis and deal with the then high-flying
	dollar.

	NEAR TERM STRENGTH SEEN FOR CURRENCY FUTURES
TOPICS:

	Currency futures are likely to move
	higher following the sharp rally today after President Reagan
	announced that Paul Volcker would not accept a third term as
	Federal Reserve Chairman and that Alan Greenspan was nominated
	as his replacement, currency analysts said.
	    Contrary to predictions before the Volcker resignation,
	analysts are calling for higher currency futures prices between
	now and the June 8 Venice economic summit.
	    In particular, uncertainty about Greenspan's attitude to
	the dollar could undermine sentiment toward the U.S. currency,
	analysts said.
	    Greenspan said today that the dollar appeared to be nearing
	a bottom, but the market will bear in mind his remarks in
	Chicago last week that the dollar's recent move upward was a
	technical reaction and that it would trade significantly lower,
	analysts said.
	   
	    "Disappointment of European central bankers over the
	appointment will be used as an opportunity to sell the dollar
	lower," said Manufacturers Hanover Futures vice president Carol
	Mackoff.
	    "The international community will not like this
	appointment," as it suggests the possibility that the U.S.
	budget deficit is too much of a burden on monetary policy and
	that Volcker was unable to get the commitment he sought to
	reduce the deficit, added Merrill Lynch Economics analyst David
	Horner.
	     Furthermore, "that Greenspan was not named two months ago
	suggests that he was not the Administration's first choice --
	and that the status of his appointment was as a bridesmaid,"
	Horner said.
	    A declining dollar scenario with higher currency futures
	prior to and throughout the Venice meetings would be mitigated
	only by concrete action as opposed to "jawboning" at the G-7
	summit, he said.
	    But G-7 finance ministers, judged by recent statements, may
	be at an impasse, analysts said.
	    Japan and West Germany today reiterated that neither
	planned further interest rate cuts, despite pressure from the
	U.S. to do so, Mackoff said.
	    The U.S., on the other hand, has not cut its budget deficit
	as Japan and West Germany have urged, she said.
	    Should G-7 members force a U.S. commitment to cut its
	budget deficit in the next two years, a further decline in the
	dollar could be forestalled, Horner said.
	    However, "the impact from Venice will be nothing if nothing
	changes," Horner said.
	    Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. analyst Craig Sloane
	said European currencies will likely move to the higher end of
	their 1987 ranges after today's sharp advance.
	    For the next two weeks, Sloan calls for September yen
	futures to advance toward the 0.007200 area. He said September
	marks could close in on 0.5700 as an upside target, while Swiss
	francs could climb to a range between 0.6900 and 0.6950.
