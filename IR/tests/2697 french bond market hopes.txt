	FRENCH PRIMARY BOND MARKET SHOWS NEW SPARKLE
TOPICS:
	interest, money-fx
PLACES:
	france
CONTENT:
	The French primary bond market is showing
	signs of renewed effervescence after several weeks of lethargy
	and the trend is expected to continue if hopes of imminent
	interest rate cuts are fulfilled, market operators said.
	    The Bank of France is generally expected to give a signal
	to the market, possibly at the beginning of next week, by
	announcing a quarter point cut in its intervention rate, which
	has stood at eight pct since January 2, or in its seven-day
	repurchase rate, set at 8-3/4 pct since January 5.
	    The central bank's averaged-out day to day call money rate,
	the reference rate for interbank money market operators, which
	reached 8-3/4 pct on February 18 has fallen to 7-3/4 pct this
	week, dealers noted.
	    The Bank of France's "open market" policy to regulate the
	money markets since December has been based on a floor and
	ceiling of rates within the limits of its intervention and
	seven day repurchase rates.
	    For the moment the sentiment is of "wait and see" on rate
	cuts, but there are now more optimists than pessimists among
	market operators, a dealer for a major French bank said.
	    Dealers said there is abundant liquidity on the bond
	market, noting that this week's monthly Treasury tap issue of
	11.87 billion francs had a good reception and was fairly easily
	absorbed.
	    The Treasury had set an upper limit on the issue of 12
	billion francs and was likely to continue to try and sell as
	much paper as it could over coming months to meet its borrowing
	needs for this year of around 150 billion, one banker said.
	    Dealers said there was no difficulty in placing liquidity
	in the primary market at the moment despite competition from
	the surge in investments on the Paris stock exchange.
	    There has been a flood of large bond issues, but with
	formulas well adapted to market conditions and investor demand
	- with warrants or a mix of fixed and floating-rates - which
	have been snapped up, and with generally broadly negative fees.
	    Dealers pointed to the recent Caisse d'Aide a l'Equipement
	des Collectivites Locales (CAECL) 8.90 pct two billion franc
	bond with warrants exchangeable for floating-rate bonds issued
	over 13 years and 80 days at 97.04 pct with payment date March
	9, which was today quoted at -0.90 to -1.10 pct.
	    Even classic fixed-rate issues, after being neglected since
	the end of last year, are finding buyers, one banker said.
	    Dealers said that now the question was to see how the terms
	of imminent operations would be set, with great market interest
	focussed on the likely three next issues.
	    These will include an expected four to five billion franc
	issue for Electricite de France, to be followed by a bond of
	around one billion francs for Auxiliaire du Credit Foncier, a
	subsidiary of the banking group Credit Foncier de France, and a
	new issue by tender from the mortgage agency Caisse de
	Refinancement Hypothecaire.

	DOLLAR ENDS LOWER IN LACKLUSTRE FRANKFURT

CONTENT:
	The dollar drifted down to end one
	pfennig lower after a lacklustre session, held in limits by the
	lack of concrete news from the Group of Seven meeting and
	comments on the edge of the Washington IMF/World Bank meeting.
	    Dealers said the communique early in the European morning
	from the G-7 meeting contained no significant new factors and
	although the dollar dipped it generally resisted further
	attempts to push it lower through the day.
	    The U.S. Currency ended at 1.8270/80 marks, below
	yesterday's last 1.8365/75.
	    Koch said the assessment of the dollar's direction was
	based on a global view, with operators paying most attention to
	comments by finance officials to see how closely they stated
	adherence to international agreements such as those set at the
	Plaza Hotel in 1985 and in Paris on February 22.
	    Koch described the wording of the communique from the G-7
	as "soft as wax."
	    Bundebank vice-president Helmut Schlesinger told Reuters in
	a telephone interview that the German central bank sees no
	current reason to change monetary course at present.
	    Schlesinger was responding to questions following remarks
	yesterday by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler and West
	Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss, which dealers
	said revived some speculation that German interest rate cuts
	may be under consideration.
	    German call money was slightly softer today, at around 3.70
	pct after 3.80 yesterday.
	    Some dealers said rates on new liquidity injections added
	via Bundesbank securities repurchase agreements may be cut next
	week. Hopes of a cut were dashed on Tuesday with an allocation
	at an unchanged 3.80 pct.
	    But speaking of the pact tender rate next week, Schlesinger
	said, "since the central bank council gives its opinion on this
	theme only every 14 days, this is hardly probable."
	    Euromark rates scarcely responded to the central bankers
	comments, with six months funds ending unaltered at around
	3-7/8 pct. Eurodollars for the same maturity rose a fractional
	1/16 pct from yesterday to around 6-11/16 pct.
	    Sterling dipped to end at 2.952/956 marks after 2.960/965
	last night. The Swiss franc firmed slightly to 120.30/45 marks
	per 100 from 120.25/40, with the yen soaring however to
	1.2570/90 marks per 100 from 1.2515/35 yesterday.
	    EMS currencies saw the French franc end unchanged from last
	night at 30.03/06 marks per 100, with the Belgian franc easing
	however to 4.829/831 marks per 100 from 4.831/833.

	U.K. RESERVES LIFT HOPES OF FURTHER BASE RATE CUT
TOPICS:
	reserves, interest
PLACES:

CONTENT:
	The record 4.9 billion dlrs rise in U.K.
	Reserves in May to a total 34.7 billion has lifted hopes for a
	further cut in bank base lending rates after the June 11
	general election, market analysts said.
	    Sterling would have risen on the much better than expected
	number but for market nerves about the poll outcome, they said.
	    But the weight of foreign currency and gold reserves now
	available to the authorities to support the pound should curb
	any market tendency to panic if U.K. Opinion polls show the
	ruling Conservative Party's lead slipping, they added.
	    "We have been intervening to a very much greater extent than
	we have done hitherto," Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson
	said at a news conference today, commenting on the news of the
	record reserves rise.
	    He put the U.K. Intervention in the context of the Louvre
	accord between leading industrial nations to stabilise the
	dollar, partly through direct intervention on foreign
	exchanges. "We have been playing a very full part ourselves," he
	said.
	    But market analysts see the recent upward pressure on
	sterling, and consequent need for official sales to damp down
	its rise, more in the light of local factors.
	    Steven Bell, chief economist at Morgan Grenfell Securities,
	said that corporate money has been flowing back into Britain
	amid hopes of another Conservative government, after fears last
	autumn of a Labour election victory sent it flooding out.
	    U.K. Portfolio investment is also returning, while foreign
	buyers see U.K. Growth propects and high bond yields as
	attractive. They will be strong buyers of U.K. Assets, notably
	equities, once the election is out of the way, Bell said.
	    Analysts see this pressure as the main hope for lower
	interest rates, as the government is expected to try to reverse
	the loss of export competitiveness caused by a strong pound.
	    Today, however, the pound hardly moved on the reserves
	news, dipping on its trade-weighted index against a basket of
	currencies from 73.1 pct of its 1975 value at 1000 GMT to 73.0
	pct at 1100 GMT, half an hour after the figures were released.
	    "The market doesn't want to do anything because of the
	election," commented an economist at a big U.S. Investment bank.
	    Several dealers and analysts added that market forecasts of
	a rise in reserves of between one and three billion dlrs had
	overestimated the amount of pound sales that were likely to
	have been disguised by swap arrangements or transactions on the
	forward market.
	    The market also seemed to have overestimated the amount of
	sterling the Bank of England bought at the end of May to smooth
	the pound's sudden downturn, while some of the intervention
	reported in May probably occurred in April, they said.
	    The key three months interbank money market rates eased
	about 1/8 point, reflecting cautious hopes that the downtrend
	in U.K. Interest rates will be revived following the reserves
	news, analysts said.
	    Government bond prices initially firmed, but the market was
	muted as traders worried about the funding implications of
	another huge rise in reserves, they added.
	    Morgan Grenfell's Bell forecast a half point base rate cut
	from the current nine pct level soon after the election, so
	long as poll projections of another Conservative victory prove
	accurate, with another half point later.
	    Justin Silverton, equity economist at Credit Suisse
	Buckmaster and Moore, said a full point reduction might be
	possible. "Sterling will be held down by interest rate cuts in
	future, rather than this active intervention," he predicted.
	    Kevin Boakes of Greenwell Montagu Gilt-Edged cautioned
	against over-optimistic forecasts, but agreed a half point cut
	looked likely.
	    A cut before the election has been virtually ruled out.
	    "The Bank (of England) is both worried about the political
	problem of cutting rates during an election campaign ... And
	has signalled some worry about broad money (growth)," said Robin
	Marshall, chief U.K. Economist at Chase Manhattan Securities.
	    He said the 10 billion dlrs increase in total reserves in
	the past seven months may foreshadow full U.K. Entry into the
	European Monetary System.
	    But Bell said the authorities would like to see another 10
	or 15 billion dlrs in the reserves before joining, if they did
	so. But, unlike many analysts, he doubted the U.K. Will go in.

	HUNGARY HOPES DEVALUATION WILL END TRADE DEFICIT
TOPICS:
	trade, money-fx, cpi, reserves
PLACES:
	hungary
CONTENT:
	National Bank of Hungary first
	vice-president Janos Fekete said he hoped a planned eight pct
	devaluation of the forint will spur exports and redress last
	year's severe trade deficit with the West.
	    Fekete told Reuters in an interview Hungary must achieve at
	least equilibrium on its hard currency trade.
	    "It is useful to have a devaluation," he said. "There is now a
	real push to our exports and a bit of a curb to our imports."
	    The official news agency MTI said today Hungary would
	devalue by eight pct and it expected the new rates to be
	announced later today. Fekete said the rates would come into
	effect tomorrow.
	    He said one reason for the devaluation was that Hungary had
	a higher rate of inflation over the past two years than its
	main partners (around eight pct in 1985 and between five and
	5.5 pct in 1986).
	    This was partly an after-effect of action Hungary took to
	prevent inflation from soaring during the oil price shocks of
	the 1970s, he added.
	    Hungary devalued by a similar amount last September and by
	between three and four pct early last year.
	    But the country's hard currency trade balance nevertheless
	fell into a deficit of 539.4 mln dlrs from a surplus of 295.3
	mln in 1986 and 1.2 billion in 1985.
	    Fekete said Hungary was hoping for a hard currency trade
	surplus of between 200 and 300 mln dlrs this year, but that a
	more likely outcome would be closer to equilibrium on total
	hard currency trade of around 10 billion dlrs.
	    One Western commercial attache here said: "Devaluation of
	itself will not change anything. It will only be useful if they
	also make efforts to restructure industry and improve the
	quality of their export goods."
	    Fekete said he hoped to raise credits on good terms this
	year to invest in restructuring industry.
	    It would be his role to persuade international banks to
	cooperate in this process. He noted Hungary had been given an
	AA rating enabling it to raise money on the Japanese Samurai
	bond market.
	    Hungary's net hard currency debt soared to 7.79 billion
	dlrs last year from 5.01 billion in 1985, partly because of a
	current account deficit of 1.42 billion dlrs and partly because
	the fall in the dollar increased the dollar value of debt
	denominated in marks or yen.
	    He said he feared net debt would also rise slightly this
	year, but he was in favour of borrowing for the purpose of
	modernisation.
	    "I am for credits to invest for that purpose," he said. "I am
	against credits for consumption." He forecast gross domestic
	product growth of two pct this year, from one pct in 1986.
	   Fekete said Hungary would continue to restructure its debt
	profile by prepaying high interest shorter and medium term
	loans with cheaper long term money for which it was looking
	more and more to the fixed interest rate bond market, where he
	considered rates to be low.
	    Hard currency foreign exchange reserves would stay at
	around 3.5 billion dlrs, he said. On the budget deficit, which
	tripled to a provisional 47 billion forints last year after
	quadrupling in 1985, Fekete said the finance ministry was
	working out measures to reduce an approved target deficit for
	this year of 43.8 billion forints to between 30 and 35 billion
	forints.

	CANADA SETS OFF ITS OWN BIG BANG
TOPICS:
	
PLACES:

CONTENT:
	stock
	market deregulation -- will be heard Tuesday when the Canadian
	securities industry sets off its own fireworks.
	    Some companies are quickly taking advantage of
	deregulation, but more significant moves are likely to be a
	year or more down the road, analysts say.
	    They say most foreign firms will focus at first on bond
	trading, debt financing and underwriting, areas in which they
	have experience under the old rules that allowed them to
	provide government debt financing and advisory services.
	    "When they learn about Canada, they might go into retail,"
	said Carney at Merrill Lynch Canada. "Then they will eventually
	just start to buy up the little guys. If the bigger boys' price
	comes down, they'll end up taking those ones over too."
	    Under the new rules, barriers that kept banks, brokerage
	houses, insurance companies and trust firms out of each others'
	businesses will be swept away in favor of wide-open
	competition.
	    The deregulation, sometimes nicknamed "Little Bang," will
	allow Canadian banks and other domestic financial institutions
	to set up securities units or acquire existing brokerages.
	    Foreign companies will also be able to form their own
	securities divisions in Ontario or buy up to 50 pct of a
	Canadian firm. A year from now they can raise that stake to 100
	pct. Foreign firms that entered Canada after 1971 can currently
	own no more than 10 pct of a Canadian brokerage.
	    Deregulation was expected to generate a major shakeout by
	June 30, involving mergers of existing firms and buyouts by
	foreign and domestic financial giants.
	    So far few deals have become reality, however, despite a
	swirl of rumors and merger talks. In the heat of deregulation
	fever, many Canadian investment dealers are demanding up to
	four times book value, scaring off prospective suitors,
	analysts said.
	    "I would think they (the brokerages) will have to lower
	their asking prices," said financial services analyst Jeff
	Carney at Merrill Lynch Canada Inc., which recently terminated
	talks to acquire prominent Canadian brokerage Burns Fry Ltd.
	    "I think (a high asking price) is what scared Merrill Lynch
	away from Burns Fry," added Carney. "It is just a lot of money.
	When your asset walks out the door every night, it is difficult
	to pay that amount of cash."
	    Carney said another factor in the slow pace of buyouts was
	uncertainty about the final deregulation rules, which were
	issued and approved only in mid-June.
	    Most major foreign and Canadian financial players have
	focused their deregulation strategy on planning their own
	Canadian securities units or buying seats on the Toronto Stock
	Exchange, Canada's largest equities market.
	    Japan's Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Yamaichi Securities Co.
	Ltd., Daiwa Securities Co. Ltd. and Nikko Securities Co. Ltd.
	recently bought seats on Toronto's exchange, while United
	States investment banks such as Salomon Inc. and Goldman, Sachs
	and Co. have set plans for Canadian subsidiaries.
	    The few proposed foreign investments in Ontario firms
	include agreements by New York's Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
	to raise its stake in McLeod Young Weir Ltd. to 30 pct from 10
	pct and by the British firm of James Capel and Co. to acquire a
	minority interest in Brown, Baldwin, Nisker Ltd.
	    Several industry watchers predict the flood of foreign
	acquisitions is likely a year away, when the newcomers become
	familiar with Canada.
	    Canadian firms will need such international alliances to
	compete in the increasingly global securities market, industry
	officials said.
	    "That is one of the hopes of the regulators, that the change
	will throw off one or two Canadian global firms," Toronto Stock
	Exchange president Pearce Bunting told Reuters recently.
	    Canada's six major banks are also expected to proceed
	cautiously into the securities field.
	    Analysts said the brokers are too expensive now while the
	banks are coping with Brazilian loan problems. Banks will also
	find it tough to merge their cautious, bureaucratic culture
	with that of leaner, more free-wheeling securities dealers,
	they said.
	    While the banks have been approached by securities firms
	seeking merger partners, they have not yet bought into
	brokerages, choosing to build securities units from within.
	    Last week, Royal Bank of Canada, the country's biggest
	bank, ended merger talks with Canadian broker Wood Gundy Inc.
	after several months of negotiations.
	    But analyst Thompson forecast that if one bank finally
	acquires an existing firm, "all the other banks will jump in.
	    "They don't want to be perceived as missing out on
	something," said Prudential-Bache Securities Canada Ltd. analyst
	Albert Thompson, who believes that brokerages are too expensive
	a risk for banks.

	IMF URGES BELGIUM TO MAKE FURTHER SPENDING CUTS
TOPICS:

PLACES:

CONTENT:
	The Belgian government, which
	introduced large-scale public spending reductions last year,
	has been told by an International Monetary Fund team there is
	scope for further cuts in 1988.
	    The suggestion is contained in the preliminary conclusions
	of the annual IMF consultations with Belgium on its economic
	policy, a copy of which was distributed to journalists at the
	weekly press conference following meetings of the cabinet.
	    The IMF team also urges Belgium to adopt a firm interest
	rate policy, with a particular emphasis on long-term rates.
	    The team's report to the government praises last year's
	spending cuts, which are due to reduce 1987 government spending
	by 195 billion francs, and says 1986 saw the Belgian economy
	perform "better, on a broader basis, than at any time so far in
	the 1980s."
	    However, it adds that with lower inflation, stabilisation
	of the debt to gross national product ratio requires a much
	lower budget deficit than the seven pct of GNP target the
	government has set itself for 1989.
	    The government's net financing requirement was 11.0 pct of
	GNP in 1986.
	    The report says "The most that can be afforded over the next
	few years is a zero growth of real non-interest expenditure of
	general Government."
	    It says there is a need for a revision of the Belgian tax
	system to iron out distortions and meet hopes of a reduced tax
	burden but substantial progress is needed in stabilising the
	debt to GNP ratio before this is possible.
	    "Because of the difficulty of sustaining zero expenditure
	growth and of likely growing impatience (for) tax reductions,
	we feel that your position would be stronger if you could
	decide on rather sharp expenditure reductions in 1988," the
	report adds.
	    The IMF urges a strong interest rate policy to signal the
	government's determination to keep its currency strong and to
	curb inflation.
	    It says firmer long-term rates would slow private net
	long-term capital outflows, which increased strongly in 1986.
	    It also urges net repayments of foreign currency debt and
	an overhaul of domestic capital markets to facilitate the
	subscriptions by non-residents of government bond issues in
	Belgian francs.

	SUMITOMO BANK AIMS AT QUICK RECOVERY FROM MERGER
TOPICS:
	acq
PLACES:
	japan, usa
CONTENT:
	Sumitomo Bank Ltd <SUMI.T> is certain to
	lose its status as Japan's most profitable bank as a result of
	its merger with the Heiwa Sogo Bank, financial analysts said.
	    Osaka-based Sumitomo, with desposits of around 23.9
	trillion yen, merged with Heiwa Sogo, a small, struggling bank
	with an estimated 1.29 billion dlrs in unrecoverable loans, in
	October.
	    But despite the link-up, Sumitomo President Koh Komatsu
	told Reuters he is confident his bank can quickly regain its
	position.
	    "We'll be back in position in first place within three
	years," Komatsu said in an interview.
	    He said that while the merger will initially reduce
	Sumitomo's profitability and efficiency, it will vastly expand
	Sumitomo's branch network in the Tokyo metropolitan area where
	it has been relatively weak.
	    But financial analysts are divided on whether and how
	quickly the gamble will pay off.
	    Some said Sumitomo may have paid too much for Heiwa Sogo in
	view of the smaller bank's large debts. Others argue the merger
	was more cost effective than creating a comparable branch
	network from scratch.
	    The analysts agreed the bank was aggressive. It has
	expanded overseas, entered the lucrative securities business
	and geared up for domestic competition, but they questioned the
	wisdom of some of those moves.
	    "They've made bold moves to put everything in place. Now
	it's largely out of their hands," said Kleinwort Benson Ltd
	financial analyst Simon Smithson.
	    Among Sumitomo's problems are limits placed on its move to
	enter U.S. Securities business by taking a share in American
	investment bank Goldman, Sachs and Co.
	    Sumitomo last August agreed to pay 500 mln dlrs for a 12.5
	pct limited partnership in the bank, but for the time being at
	least, the Federal Reserve Board has forbidden them to exchange
	personnel, or increase the business they do with each other.
	    "The tie-up is widely looked on as a lame duck because the
	Fed was stricter than Sumitomo expected," said one analyst.
	    But Komatsu said the move will pay off in time.
	    "U.S. Regulations will change in the near future and if so,
	we can do various things. We only have to wait two or three
	years, not until the 21st century," Komatsu said.
	    Komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routes
	into the securities business at home.
	    Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act, Japan's
	version of the U.S. Glass-Steagall Act, separates commercial
	from investment banking.
	    But the walls between the two are crumbling and Komatsu
	said he hopes further deregulation will create new
	opportunities.
	    "We need to find new business chances," Komatsu said. "In some
	cases these will be securities related, in some cases trust
	bank related. That's the kind of deregulation we want."
	    Until such changes occur, Sumitomo will focus on such
	domestic securities business as profitable government bond
	dealing and strengthening relations with Meiko Securities Co
	Ltd, in which it holds a five pct share, Komatsu said.
	    He said Sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about entering
	the securities business here through its Swiss universal bank
	subsidiary, Banca del Gottardo.
	     The Finance Ministry is expected to grant licences to
	securities subsidiaries of U.S. Commercial banks soon,
	following a similar decision for subsidiaries of European
	universal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct.
	    But Komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similar
	decision on a Gottardo subsidiary.
	    "We don't want to make waves. We expect this will be allowed
	in two or three years," he said.
	    Like other city banks, Sumitomo is also pushing to expand
	lending to individuals and small and medium businesses to
	replace disappearing demand from big business, he added.
	    The analysts said Sumitomo will have to devote a lot of
	time to digesting its most recent initiatives, including the
	merger with ailing Heiwa Sogo.
	    "It's (Sumitomo) been bold in its strategies," said
	Kleinwort's Smithson.
	    "After that, it's a question of absorbing and juggling
	around. It will be the next decade before we see if the
	strategy is right or wrong."

	SWISSAIR PLANE ORDER FOR 1.2 BILLION SWISS FRANCS

	Swissair <SWSZ.Z> said that the order
	for McDonnell Douglas Corp <MD> MD-11 long haul jets confirmed
	this morning was worth a total 1.2 billion Swiss francs.
	    President Robert Staubli told a news conference it had not
	yet been decided whether the planes would have General Electric
	Co <GE.N>, Pratt and Whitney <UTX> or Rolls Royce engines.
	    The airline said it chose the U.S. Plane rather than the
	rival A-340 of the European Airbus consortium because it met
	better the Swissair requirements and would be able to enter
	service in 1990 giving a smooth transition from the DC-10s it
	replaces.
	    Staubli said Swissair planned to have replaced its whole
	fleet of 11 DC10s by 1992 at the latest, entailing the order of
	five more long-haul planes in addition to the six announced
	today. He said it would decide on the basis of the development
	of traffic whether these five would be MD-11s or Boeing 747s.
	    However, Staubli ruled out the possibility that Swissair
	might eventually choose A-340s. "We cannot afford to operate
	three different types of aircraft," he said.
	    Swissair also had no short term plans to exercise its
	option to buy Airbus A-310s, of which it already operates nine,
	officials said. But it would still hold the options open.
	    Staubli declined to say how much it paid for each of the
	MD-11s. The total 1.2 billion franc figure was not only for the
	planes but also for spare parts and other related expenditure.
	    Company officials said that Swissair intended to cover
	around 75 pct of the costs of its entire DC-10 replacement
	programme with internally generated funds. It hopes to raise
	the remaining 25 pct on the Swiss and other capital markets
	through issuing straight or equity related bonds and/or through
	a capital increase.
	    The first such bond issue would likely come this year, they
	predicted.

	PRESSURE GROWS FOR U.S. ACTION TO AID DOLLAR
TOPICS:
	dlr, money-fx, interest
PLACES:
	usa
CONTENT:
	Pressure is growing in the financial
	markets for the U.S. to take overt action to stabilize the
	dollar even though doubts linger that it has fallen far enough
	to help redress world trade imbalances, economists and dealers
	said.
	    Some experts believe that a half-point increase in the U.S.
	discount rate, preferably in conjunction with rate cuts in
	Tokyo and Bonn, would be enough to discourage sellers.
	    But many fear that more drastic action, such as a U.S.
	issue of yen-denominated Treasury bonds, may be needed.
	    Despite official warnings about the dangers of a further
	dollar decline and concerted central bank intervention, the
	dollar extended its recent sharp depreciation, touching a
	40-year low of 137.25 yen in Tokyo earlier today after closing
	here on Friday at 139.30/40.
	    The impact on other financial markets was devastating.
	    In Tokyo, the stock market suffered its largest single day
	decline; in London, gold bullion prices rose to four-year highs
	and in the U.S., long Treasury bond yields surged above 8.80
	pct and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 40
	points in hectic early trading.
	    "The problem now is linkage. This is not just a currency
	problem. It is affecting all the markets," said one senior
	trader at a major U.S. bank.
	    Up until September of last year, international efforts to
	redress world trade imbalances appeared to working like a
	dream; the dollar was falling in an orderly manner, world
	interest rates were tumbling and inflation was kept in check.
	    In recent months, however, this strategy has begun to show
	signs of severe stress, with the U.S. imposition of punitive
	tariffs on Japan threatening to unravel this spirit of
	cooperating and condemn the world to a damaging trade war.
	    "The markets fear that we have built up a momentum that is
	really difficult to stop. A U.S. rate hike has become an
	inevitability," one currency dealer said.
	    "At this point, nothing short of a Fed discount rate
	increase, ideally combined with further discount rate cuts by
	Japan and Germany, would seem capable of stabilizing the
	dollar," said David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc.
	    Allen Sinai of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc predicted a 1/4
	to 1/2 point U.S. rate increase before May 19 and a rise in
	U.S. bank prime lending rates to eight pct from 7-3/4 pct in
	the near future.
	    But many economists feared that any moderate U.S. rate
	increases, which appear unlikely to be matched by rate cuts
	overseas, would be too little, too late.
	    "They should have done this 10 days ago. It would have done
	the trick then," said one currency analyst.
	    "If they do it now, it would be seen as a defensive measure
	not an offensive one. It would show policy weakness not
	strength," added one trader.
	    In addition, economists fear that a discount rate rise
	might place additional strain on a sluggish U.S. economy and
	tempt embattled debtor nations to retaliate.
	    A U.S. discount rate increase would also fuel the
	protectionist fires in Washington, where the House is expected
	to pass a protectionist trade bill, whatever compromises
	President Reagan and Prime Minister Nakasone can come up with
	during their summit later in the week.
	    "Politically, they can't really do it this week," said one
	currency analyst, pointing out that if it failed to stabilize
	the dollar, it would only weaken the U.S. negotiating stance.
	    Even if the U.S. retains the upper hand, economists and
	traders do not hold out high hopes for any major new
	initiatives from this week's talks.
	    At best, the experts see some sort of accord whereby Japan
	will agree to stimulate growth and open its domestic markets to
	outsiders while the U.S. promises to lift its tariffs and
	support the Group of Seven dollar stabilization agreement.
	    But many fear that this may not be enough to assuage the
	market's speculative selling fervor, which has now raised fears
	of weak overseas interest at next week's quarterly U.S.
	Treasury refunding program.
	    Japanese and European investors have traditionally played
	an active role in these auctions, which are expected to total
	28 to 29 billion dlrs.
	    Consequently, thoughts are turning to the possibility that
	President Reagan may try to remove foreign investors' worries
	about currency risk by financing part of the U.S. budget
	deficit in yen or mark bonds, rather than dollars.
	    While similar action by former President Carter helped to
	stabilize the dollar in 1978, the White House is clearly
	reluctant to take such a step, economists said.
	    This hesitance was amply shown last Friday when U.S.
	Treasury Secretary James Baker said, "there might well be some
	who would view (yen-denominated bonds) as a lack of confidence
	by the U.S. in its own currency."
	    Baker added, "therefore we don't think it's an appropriate
	thing to do."
	    A foreign exchange analyst at a major Japanese bank here
	shared Baker's doubts. "Dollar defending measures are very
	unlikely. They will confirm the dollar's weak undertone and
	lead to further speculative dollar selling," he said.
	    Thus, it may be less destabilizing for the authorities to
	stop trying to fight the market's bearish sentiment.
	    In a recent lengthy report, economists at Morgan Guaranty
	Trust Co concluded, "the dollar should be left free to trade at
	whatever level market forces produce."

	ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT -FRANCE AWAITS ECONOMIC LIFT
TOPICS:
	cpi
PLACES:
	france
CONTENT:
	A year after squeezing to power with a
	narrow bare coalition majority, Gaullist Prime minister Jacques
	Chirac has swept away a cobweb of controls and regulations
	choking the French economy.
	    But France is still waiting for a promised industrial
	recovery the government says will follow from its free market
	policies. Company profits and the stock market are rising. But
	so is unemployment. Growth is stagnant at about two pct a year
	and the outlook for inflation, held to a 20-year low of 2.1 pct
	in 1986, is uncertain.
	    Forced last month to cut the government's 1987 growth
	target and raise its inflation estimate, Finance Minister
	Edouard Balladur ruled out action to stimulate the economy. But
	some government supporters say they fear time for an economic
	miracle may be running out.
	    The political clock is ticking towards Presidential
	elections due by April next year.
	    France's economic performance, led by a mixed cast of
	right-wing ministers and a socialist President, has won mixed
	reviews from non-partisan analysts.
	    For Michel Develle, Director of Economic Studies at
	newly-privatised Banque Paribas, the government's outstanding
	achievement has been to launch "a veritable intellectual
	revolution" breaking the staid habits formed by centuries of
	state control.
	    "The figures may look mediocre -- neither good nor bad --
	but set in their context of structural reforms, they are
	excellent," Develle said.
	    But some analysts say they fear that Balladur, chief
	architect of the government's free market policies, may be
	pursuing a mirage.
	    "The belief that economic liberalism will produce an
	explosion of economic forces is ideological" said Indosuez chief
	economist Jean Cheval. "Personally I think it's an illusion.
	Dirigisme (direction) is a basic fact of the French system,
	from school onwards. Ultra-liberalism is impossible."
	    Illusion or not, the government has pushed its vision hard.
	Over the past year foreign exchange and consumer price controls
	have been largely abolished, labour regulations have been
	pruned to ease the sacking of redundant workers and a hugely
	popular programme has been launched to sell state-owned banks
	and industries to private investors.
	    Since December, nearly five mln French investors have
	bought shares in Cie Financiere de Paribas <PARI.PA> and glass
	maker Cie de Saint-Gobain SA <SGEP.PA>, the first two state
	companies brought to the stock market under the 300 billion
	franc five-year privatisation plan.
	    Encouraged by an amnesty for past illegal exports of
	capital, and the lifting of most currency controls, money has
	flooded into the Paris stockmarket from abroad, helping to lift
	the market 57 pct last year and another 12.5 pct since
	December.
	    At the end of last year the government abolished price
	controls that had existed for 42 years on services such as car
	repairs and hairdressing, freeing from state intervention small
	businesses which account for some 60 pct of the French economy.
	    The immediate result was a 0.9 pct rise in consumer prices
	in January, partly responsible for a forced revision in the
	official 1987 inflation forecast, to 2.5 pct from two pct or
	less.
	    "But even 2.5 pct would be a fantastic result, when you
	consider that prices are now free for the first time since
	1945," commented Develle of Paribas.
	    Other achievements include a major reduction in the state's
	foreign debts, and a cut in the state budget deficit to 141.1
	billion francs last year, 2.5 billion francs below target and
	down from 153.3 billion in 1985.
	    But despite a healthy balance of payments surplus and a
	gradual improvement in industrial productivity, the French
	franc was forced by speculators in January into a humiliating
	three pct devaluation against the West German mark, its second
	since Chirac took power.
	    A recent report by the Organisation for Economic
	Cooperation and Development pilloried French industry for
	failing to produce the goods that its potential customers
	wanted.
	    Outside the mainly state-controlled high technology
	sectors, French industrial goods were "increasingly ill-adapted
	to demand" and over-priced, the report said.
	    French economists, including Cheval at Indosuez, agreed
	with the report. "One of the assumptions of the government is
	that if you give them freedom, the employers will invest and
	modernise....But nine out of ten will say yes, they like
	freedom, and then wait to be told which way to go," he said.
	    And despite rising industrial investment and the
	introduction of special incentives to boost youth employment,
	the end-1986 number of jobless was reported at a record 2.7
	million, some 300,000 more than a year earlier.
	    The problem for the government is that there may be little
	more it can do to prod the economy into faster growth.
	    French producers failed more than most to take advantage of
	last year's oil price falls and growth hopes now rest on the
	shaky prospects of expansion in other industrial countries like
	West Germany and Japan, they say.

	U.K. ISSUES ONE BILLION STG BOND TRANCHE

	The Bank of England said it was taking
	onto its books a further one billion stg tranche of 8-3/4 pct
	Treasury Loan stock due 1997, payable 40 stg pct on
	application. The stock was issued to the Bank at 96.50 stg pct
	and will be available for dealings from March 11, with the
	remainder of the amount payable on May 5. The Bank said the
	bonds would yield 9.28 pct at the issue price and would be free
	of tax to residents overseas. The issue would be designated
	8-3/4 pct Treasury Loan 1997 "B."  A further 100 mln stg was
	reserved for the National Debt Commissioners.
	    The market dropped by up to 1/2 point following the Bank's
	announcement, with the Treasury 13-1/2 pct stock due 2004/08
	quoted one full point lower at 134-12/32 stg pct around 20
	minutes after the news.
	    Dealers said the announcement had to be viewed against the
	backdrop of intense pressure for lower U.K. Interest rates
	which had built up over the past two weeks as a result of
	sterling's strength.
	    The Bank this morning finally signalled it was prepared to
	see lower rates and U.K. Clearing banks this afternoon
	announced cuts in their base lending rates to 10.5 pct from 11
	pct.
	    The Bank had initially been reluctant to countenance a rate
	cut because, dealers said, the authorities had wished to delay
	a reduction until around the time of the U.K. Budget on March
	17, thereby preserving the full impact of Chancellor of the
	Exchequer Nigel Lawson's package of measures.
	    However, in the face of sterling's apparently inexorable
	climb, the authorities today decided to cede to pressure and
	allow a half-point cut.
	    Today's one billion stg tap issue was viewed by the market
	as a move by the Bank to eradicate hopes for a further early
	rate cut which might arise as a result of strong sterling.
	    Most market participants believe that Lawson will now
	foster a further half point interest rate reduction at the time
	of the budget, although one or two said they would not be
	surprised to see a full point decline at this stage.
	    Dealers noted that as part of the authorities' attempts
	last week to ease pressure for lower rates, the Bank had issued
	a one billion stg tap stock with a view to subduing the
	Government bond market.
	    To the surprise of most participants, the issue was sold
	out within hours of becoming available for trading and the
	market pushed on to register further sharp gains.
	    Dealers said that at this stage it seemed unlikely that the
	issue announced today would be absorbed by the market as
	rapidly as last week's.
	    However, they noted that although sterling had edged down
	from its highs following the base rate cut, it had still closed
	on a trade-weighted basis at 72.4, well ahead of Friday's final
	71.8 and only just beneath the peak of 72.5 touched at 1300
	GMT.

	taking the remaining 80 pct.
	    Sweden's <AB LM Ericsson> has also submitted a bid for the
	maximum 20 pct permitted, in association with French defence
	electronics group <Matra>, which would hold between 40 and 49
	pct, and construction group <Bouygues>.
	    Matra has already acquired CGCT's private telephone
