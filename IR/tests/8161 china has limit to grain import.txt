	DENG SETS LIMIT TO CHINA GRAIN IMPORTS, PAPER SAYS

CONTENT:
	China's top leader Deng Xiaoping said
	China must not import more than 10 mln tonnes of grain, Ming
	Pao newspaper of Hong Kong said.
	    Customs figures show that China imported 7.73 mln tonnes of
	grain in 1986, up from 5.97 mln in 1985 but down from a record
	16.15 mln in 1982.
	    The newspaper quoted Deng as saying that grain output is
	one of several key issues that will influence the whole
	development of the economy. It did not give the context of his
	remarks. The 1987 grain production target is 405 mln, up from
	391 mln in 1986.
	    The newspaper quoted Deng as saying that the situation has
	reached the point where "pigs are not fed, there is not enough
	grain and increases in output have slowed."
	    "We should in our overall economic planning put agriculture
	in its proper place to reach our target of 480 mln tonnes by
	the year 2000," he said. "We must avoid the situation in recent
	years of importing more than 10 mln tonnes of grain."
	    The paper quoted Deng as saying that the State Council has
	decided to raise the price of five grains, including corn and
	rice, unchanged since 1978, but it gave no details.

	JAPAN MINISTRY SAYS OPEN FARM TRADE WOULD HIT U.S.

CONTENT:
	Japan's Agriculture Ministry, angered by
	U.S. Demands that Japan open its farm products market, will
	tell U.S. Officials at talks later this month that
	liberalisation would harm existing U.S. Farm exports to Japan,
	a senior ministry official said.
	    "Imports from the U.S. Would drop due to active sales drives
	by other suppliers," the official, who declined to be named,
	said. "Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Farm products and
	it is not reasonable for the U.S. To demand Japan liberalise
	its farm import market," he said.
	    Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato has said if the U.S.
	Insists Japan open its protected rice market it will also open
	its wheat market, where volume and origin are regulated to
	protect local farmers.
	    Australia and Canada could then increase their wheat
	exports as they are more competitive than the U.S., He said.
	End-users would also buy other origins, grain traders said.
	    U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who is due to
	visit Japan for talks between April 16-27, has said he will ask
	Japan to offer a share of its rice market to U.S. Suppliers and
	remove quotas on U.S. Beef and citrus imports.
	    Other countries are already cutting into the U.S. Market
	share here. Australia, the largest beef supplier to Japan, has
	been trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-year
	beef accord next March 31.
	    Imports of U.S. Corn have fallen due to increased sales
	from China and South America, while Japanese soybean imports
	from Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year, although
	the U.S. Will remain the largest supplier.
	    U.S. Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up its
	beef imports, since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrain
	imports, mainly from the U.S., Japanese officials said.
	    An indication of the U.S. Position came last December when
	Under Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan has
	the potential to provide one of the largest boosts to U.S.
	Agricultural exports, with the beef market alone representing
	some one billion dlrs in new business.
	    The U.S. Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffs
	and Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese import
	controls on 12 other farm products, including fruit juices,
	purees and pulp, tomato juice, ketchup and sauce, peanuts,
	prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans.
	    To help calm heated trade relations with the U.S., Japan's
	top business group Keidanren has urged the government to remove
	residual import restrictions on agricultural products.
	    But Agriculture Minister Kato has ruled out any emotional
	reaction, and the senior ministry official said the farm issue
	should not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in the
	industrial sector.
	    "Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. Farm products, and these
	issues should not be discussed on the same table," the official
	said.

	RECENT SUGAR FALL SPARKS SOVIET, CHINESE BUYING
TOPICS:
	sugar
PLACES:
	uk, ussr, china, cuba
CONTENT:
	The recent fall in world sugar prices,
	due to increased producer pricing sales and evidence of export
	availability, has encouraged renewed buying interest from China
	and the Soviet Union, London trade house E.D.And F. Man said.
	    Further purchases are expected by the Peoples Republic of
	China at the lower end of the recent price range, which should
	limit the downside movement, it said in its latest monthly
	market report.
	   "And it is believed that the Soviet Union will need to return
	to the market to take a further 250,000/350,000 tonnes for
	May/June shipment, Man added.
	    The Soviets purchased five cargoes of raws for April/May
	shipment towards the end of last month, which brings its total
	purchases to around 1.65 mln tonnes, Man said.
	    Production estimates for the Thai crop now exceed 2.3 mln
	tonnes and the final outturn appears set to reach around 2.5
	mln tonnes. However, this upturn in the Thai crop is being
	countered by a reduction in China's production forecast to 5.3
	mln tonnes from 5.5 mln estimated earlier.
	    Market participation by Cuba suggests that its crop could
	be close to last year's 7.3 mln tonnes. But even with similar
	production Man expects Cuban exports to be significantly down.
	    Cuba was reported to be carrying 1.3 mln tonnes of stocks
	in September 1985, of which some 440,000 tonnes were used to
	boost its 1985/86 exports to about 6.9 mln. But as it will not
	be able to draw on surplus stocks this year, Man estimates
	Cuba's export availabilty will be reduced to 6.4 to 6.5 mln
	tonnes.
	    However, Cuba is only one of a large number of exporters
	with reduced availability, Man said.
	    Since 1980 the total free market export supply has fallen
	to 18 mln from about 22 mln tonnes. But at the same time free
	market demand has also fallen by almost the same amount, which
	has left exporters chasing falling import requirements.
	    A fairly tight balance now appears to have emerged. But the
	difficult task of keeping production advances at bay still
	remains, as at least one more season of production deficit is
	needed to eliminate some of the remaining surplus stocks still
	overhanging the market, Man said.
	    The increasing cases of record production as a result of
	record yields and better husbandry have forced sugar producers
	to strive for greater efficiency.
	    As this increase in efficiency reduces the marginal cost of
	production, sugar exporters may become more responsive to
	prices and in particular to upward price movements, Man said.
	    Commenting on the current row between the EC Commission and
	sugar producers, Man said despite the recent improvement in the
	level of restitutions, they are still insufficient to fully
	compensate producers when exporting on the world market.
	    Unless there are further improvements, at least some sugar
	is expected to remain in intervention, it added.

	U.S. SUGAR POLICY MAY SELF-DESTRUCT, CONGRESSMAN
TOPICS:
	sugar, grain, corn
PLACES:
	usa
CONTENT:
	A leading U.S. farm-state
	Congressman, Jerry Huckaby, D-La., warned he will press next
	year for legislation to control domestic production of
	sweeteners, perhaps including corn sweeteners, if the industry
	fails to voluntarily halt output increases this year.
	    "We're moving toward a direction where we could
	self-destruct (the U.S. sugar program)," Rep. Huckaby, chairman
	of the House agriculture subcommittee dealing with sugar
	issues, told Reuters in an interview.
	    Huckaby, who told U.S. sugarbeet growers earlier this year
	they must halt production increases, said he will deliver the
	same message to Louisiana sugarcane growers Friday. He also
	said he will soon talk with corn refiners on the subject.
	    Huckaby said the campaign to urge a halt to domestic
	sweetener output increases is an effort to forestall further
	cuts in the sugar import quota, now at one mln short tons.
	    "I think if we're talking about dropping (the quota)
	another half mln tons, lets say, you're getting to the point
	where the program might not work," he said.
	    "Ideally, I'd like to freeze things right where we are,"
	said Huckaby, leading advocate for sugar growers in Congress.
	    A freeze would mean domestic sugar production at about the
	current level of 6.5 mln tons, the corn sweetener share of the
	U.S. market staying at just over 50 pct, and U.S sugar imports
	holding at about 1.2 mln tons, Huckaby said.
	    A decision on whether to seek legislation will not be made
	until 1987 output numbers are known late this year, he said.
	    "I feel like if we didn't expand production, we could
	probably hold where we are indefinitely, or at least through
	the 1985 farm bill without any changes (in the sugar program),"
	Huckaby said.
	    However, much depends on whether high-fructose corn syrup
	producers continue to expand their share of the U.S. sweetener
	market from just over 50 pct, Huckaby said.
	    He noted most estimates are that corn sweeteners will
	capture at most only another 10 pct of the sweetener market in
	the U.S.
	    But he said if there were an economic breakthrough in the
	production of a new crystalline corn sweetener which further
	expanded the corn sweetener share, then U.S. sugar imports
	might be eliminated and U.S. sugar output severely reduced.
	    Huckaby said he will deliver this message to corn refiner
	companies such as A.E. Staley and Archer Daniels Midland soon.
	    "This program is advantageous to the corn users. They have
	some natural, legitimate self-interest in seeing that the
	program is preserved," Huckaby said.
	    Huckaby said he has asked sugar industry representatives to
	think about how domestic output could be controlled, either
	through production allocations, acreage or marketing controls.
	    Huckaby also said he would be seeking guidance from the
	Justice Department to determine if it would be legal to ask
	corn refiners to limit production.
	    "I don't know if we will go this route, but if we do
	there's a question in my mind at this point in time; can you do
	that legally?" he said.
	    Asked if he would proceed with production controls without
	the support of corn refiners, Huckaby said "You build a fragile
	house if you do it that way."
	    Huckaby said he understands why U.S. cane and beet farmers
	have expanded production, because high sugar price support
	means returns from sugar are higher than competing crops such
	as soybeans and grain.
	    But he said for sugar growers as a whole, expansion would
	not be good policy.
	    Huckaby said he has tried to stress, in his speeches to
	sugar industry groups, that if growers continue to expand, they
	may be penalized retroactively under any production control
	legislation passed next year.
	    Huckaby said Congress is unlikely to approve any changes in
	the sugar program this year despite a Reagan administration
	proposal to drastically slash the program.
	    "The administration proposal is so drastic, that I don't
	think it will get up a head of steam," Huckaby said.
	    He said even a more moderate proposal to reduce sugar price
	support is unlikely to be approved.
	    Instead of seeking to slash the domestic sugar program,
	Huckaby said the Reagan administration should file a complaint
	with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade against the
	European Community's sugar policy. He said EC policies are the
	major cause of the depressed world sugar market.

	TAIWAN SEES SHARP DECLINE IN SHIPBREAKING
TOPICS:

PLACES:

CONTENT:
	Taiwan's shipbreaking industry is
	expected to decline sharply this year despite the boom in 1986
	because of keener competition from South Korea and China, the
	rising Taiwan dollar and U.S. Import curbs on steel products,
	industry sources said.
	    Last year, Taiwanese breakers demolished a record 344
	vessels totalling 3.69 million light displacement tons (ldt),
	up on 165 of 2.97 million ldt in 1985, Lin Chung-jung, a Taiwan
	Shipbreaking Industry Association (TSIA) spokesman, told
	Reuters.
	    China scrapped vessels of some 1.1 mln ldt last year while
	South Korea demolished ships of 910,000 ldt, he said.
	    Yao Liu, president of Chi Shun Hwa Steel Co, a leading
	shipbreaker and steel producer in Kaohsiung, told Reuters, "We
	expect to scrap fewer ships this year because of an expected
	decline in our steel product exports."
	    Lin said many breakers predicted a 20 pct decline in
	scrapping operations this year due to falling demand from the
	U.S., Japan and Southeast Asia for Taiwanese steel.
	    Taiwan agreed last year to voluntarily limit its steel
	product exports to the U.S. To 120,000 tonnes in the first half
	of 1987 from about 260,000 tonnes in the first half of 1986, a
	Taiwan Steel and Iron Association official said.
	    Yao said the rising Taiwan dollar means Taiwan's steel
	exports are more expensive than South Korea's and China's.
	    The Taiwan dollar has strengthened by some 16 pct against
	the U.S. Unit since September 1985 and some bankers and
	economists said it could appreciate to 32 to the U.S. Dollar by
	the end of the year from 34.23 today, Yao said.
	    In comparison, the won rose by about five pct and yuan
	remained stable during the same period, he added.
	    "We have lost some orders to South Korea and mainland China
	because foreign importers have switched their purchases," he
	said.
	    Taiwan's steel exports to the U.S., Japan and Southeast
	Asia slipped to 148,000 tonnes in the first two months of 1987
	from about 220,000 tonnes a year earlier, the Taiwan Steel and
	Iron Association official said.
	    He said he expected further declines in later months but
	did not give figures.

	CHINA FACES DILEMMA OVER SUGAR IMPORTS
TOPICS:
	sugar

CONTENT:
	China has to decide if it will increase
	sugar imports this year to cover falling domestic output and
	rising demand, in view of market predictions that international
	sugar prices will remain firm this year, traders and the
	official press said.
	    He Kang, Minister of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and
	Fisheries, said this week that China has adjusted the
	purchasing price for sugar cane and beet to check a drop in
	production last year but he gave no price details.
	    One Japanese trader said domestic demand is rising rapidly
	because of improving living standards and rising demand for
	sweet drinks, cakes and biscuits and other sugary foods.
	    "It will not be easy to cut domestic demand, even in a
	state-controlled economy. China may have to import," he said.
	    Customs figures show imports fell to 1.182 mln tonnes in
	1986 from 1.909 mln in 1985 and fell to 25,165 tonnes in
	January 1987 from 54,000 in January 1986.
	    The official Economic Information newspaper last month said
	production in the 1986/87 crushing season (September-April)
	will be 1.18 mln tonnes short of demand.
	    The paper put 1986/87 output at 4.82 mln, down from 5.24
	mln in 1985/86, and domestic demand at about six mln tonnes.
	    "In the last two years, acreage under sugar cane and beet
	has fallen, sugar mills are underutilised, output has dropped
	and cannot meet demand that is rising every day," it said.
	    "The country will have to continue imports of sugar and draw
	down stocks to meet market demand," it added.
	    It quoted the Ministry of Light Industry as blaming the
	drop in output on unreasonable state purchasing prices for cane
	and beet as against other crops, which has resulted in farmers
	refusing to grow them.
	    The paper said in 1985 a farmer could earn up to three
	times more per hectare from pineapple and watermelon and up to
	seven times more from bananas than from sugarcane. He could
	sell grain on the free market at 560 yuan a tonne, against only
	70 yuan a tonne for sugarcane.
	    Sugar mills are suffering because refined sugar prices have
	not changed for 20 years despite rising costs, it said.
	    In Fujian, the cost of producing one tonne rose to 702 yuan
	in 1985 from 520.1 in 1980, cutting the mills' profit to 117
	yuan a tonne from 217.9, it added.
	    The paper said unreasonable pricing resulted in 144 of the
	442 sugar mills working in the 1985/86 crushing season losing
	money. China has 521 sugar mills.
	    A foreign agricultural expert forecast a drop in cane
	acreage in 1986/87 (September-August) of up to 10 pct in
	Guangdong, which produced 45 pct of China's sugar in calendar
	1985, and a smaller drop in Fujian, which produced 11 pct of
	China's sugar in calendar 1985.
	    He said both provinces are more developed than other
	sugar-producing areas and more sensitive to demand from cities.
	    But cane acreage in Guangxi and Yunnan, which accounted for
	28 pct of the 1985 crop, has risen by 10 to 30 pct in 1986/87,
	because cane-growing is more economic there, he said.
	    He put sugar stocks at 2.333 mln tonnes in September 1986.
	    A Hong Kong trader estimated stocks at more than three mln
	at end-January. "Now they are falling but (they) have not
	reached the critical level, compelling China to import quickly,"
	he said.
	    "China has options not easily available in western
	countries. It controls stocks strictly and can release less
	into the consumer market if stocks fall too quickly," he said.
	    The Hong Kong trader said calendar 1987 imports will be
	slightly less than those of 1986, because of firm world prices
	and serious foreign exchange constraints which, he said, are
	likely to continue until at least end-1988.
	    He said nearly all cane and beet is sold to the state-owned
	mills, with a small amount sold raw to consumers.
	    "Most of the mills are old and inefficient, with many of
	them using Soviet equipment imported in the 1950s," he said.
	    He said demand in rural areas will in future rise an annual
	four pct, with demand in the cities rising an annual two pct.

	    The harvest will be China's second highest in history but

	ATPC MEMBERS FIND WAYS TO CURB TIN EXPORTS

CONTENT:
	Mine and industry officials from
	most member states of the Association of Tin Producing
	Countries (ATPC) say they have found ways to limit group
	exports to 96,000 tonnes in the year started March 1, according
	to views polled by Reuter correspondents.
	    The plan to curb exports, agreed in January, is aimed at
	cutting the world surplus to 50,000 tonnes from 70,000 now and
	boosting prices to about 19 ringgit a kilo from just over 16.
	    Members of the seven-member Kuala Lumpur-based ATPC account
	for some 65 pct of the world's tin output.
	    Under the ATPC plan, Malaysia has been allocated an export
	quota of 28,526 tonnes, Indonesia 24,516, Thailand 19,000,
	Bolivia 13,761, Zaire 1,736 and Nigeria 1,461.
	    Australia has said it is not setting any export quota.
	However, the tonnage allocated to it, 7,000 tonnes, is roughly
	equal to its expected output this year.
	    Comment from officials in Zaire was unavailable.
	    Mine officials in Malaysia, the world's leading producer,
	said only 188 mines will be allowed to operate to ensure that
	output is limited to around 31,500 tonnes in the year started
	March 1.
	    Chief Inspector of Mines Redzuan Sumun told Reuters that
	excess output of some 3,000 tonnes after exports of 28,500 in
	the one-year quota period would be kept in the national stock.
	    Mine owners in Malaysia have welcomed the ATPC export curb
	and asked the government not to issue new mining licences. More
	than 100 applications for licences are pending.
	    Redzuan said the Mines Department would approve new mining
	licences only if a six-month review of production trends showed
	that local mines were not overproducing.
	    ATPC chairman and Indonesia's Mining and Energy Minister
	Subroto has pledged his country's support for the export curb.
	    A spokesman for the state-owned tin mining company PT
	Tambang Timah told Reuters it would be easy for Indonesia to
	stick to an export quota of 24,516 tonnes because this was
	close to exports in calendar 1986 of 24,636.
	    In Bangkok, Thai Industry Minister Pramual Sabhavasu said
	Thailand would keep to its 19,000 tonne quota and added this
	would not cause the local industry hardship at current prices.
	    To insure adherence, the industry ministry and sole tin
	exporter Thailand Smelting and Refining Co would encourage
	bigger stockpiles, and income tax exemptions would be
	permitted, he said.
	    The Thai Mineral Resources Department is expected to
	disallow new tin mines opening this year to prevent excessive
	production, industry sources said.
	    But Mining Industry Council President Dam Teutong told
	Reuters that if the tin price rose above 18 ringgit a kilo,
	Thai miners would press for the opening of more new mines.
	    Thailand exported 18,367 tonnes in 1986, up from 17,359 in
	1985, Pramual said.
	    Bolivia said it expects to export less tin this year than
	its allocated 13,761 tonne quota.
	    Mining Minister Jaimie Villalobos told Reuters in La Paz
	that Bolivia expected to export about 9,000 tonnes of tin in
	calendar 1987.
	    He said this was due to the sacking after the tin crisis of
	October 1985 of about 20,000 of the 28,000 workers at the state
	mining company Comibol, which produces more than 80 pct of
	Bolivia's total exports.
	    He said there were risks in the ATPC plan to cut exports
	but added he was confident the goals set by the plan would be
	achieved. He did not elaborate.
	    Mines, Power and Steel Minister Bunu Sheriff Musa said in
	Lagos that Nigeria would have no difficulty keeping within its
	ATPC quota of 1,461 tonnes because its metals output had
	declined due to poor demand and high production costs.
	    Industry sources told Reuters that Nigeria's output was
	less than 1,000 tonnes last year.
	    ATPC officials said they would monitor member countries'
	export figures every three months using customs documents and
	make projections from such data to see if quotas were likely to
	be breached within the year-long quota period.
	    The ATPC officials said members that appeared likely to
	breach their quotas would be told to take remedial measures.
	    They added that if member countries were unable to fulfil
	their quotas their extra tonnage would be reallocated to other
	members at the ATPC's discretion.
	    The ATPC would have produced and exported an estimated
	106,000 tonnes of tin in 1987 without the plan.
	    Non-members Brazil and China have pledged to cooperate with
	the ATPC and limit their exports to 21,000 and 7,000 tonnes
	respectively during the quota period.

	in 1987 because of a serious drought and increasing demand, but
	will be not be as large as in the past, Chinese officials and
	Japanese traders told Reuters.
	    They said foreign exchange constraints and national policy
	would not allow a return to large-scale imports, which peaked
	at 16.15 mln tonnes in 1982.
	    An agricultural official of the Shanghai government put
	maximum imports at about 10 mln tonnes this year, against 7.73
	mln in 1986 and 5.97 mln in 1985.
	    Officials said grain imports rose in 1986 because of a poor
	harvest and rising domestic demand, but remained below exports,
	which rose to 9.42 mln tonnes from 9.33 mln in 1985.
	    "China is short of foreign exchange," the Shanghai official
	said. "We cannot rely on imports, even at current low world
	prices. Only if there is a major disaster will we become a
	major importer."
	    A Japanese trader in Peking said Chinese grain imports
	would rise and exports fall this year because of the drought,
	low world prices and rising domestic demand for human and
	animal consumption.
	    "At current prices, China loses yuan on every tonne of grain
	it exports, though it earns foreign exchange which it badly
	needs," the trader said.
	    The People's Daily said last Saturday a serious drought is
	affecting 13.3 mln hectares of arable land, which will reduce
	the summer grain harvest from last year's level.
	    The paper added that leaders in some areas were not paying
	enough attention to agriculture, especially grain, making it
	difficult to achieve the 1987 grain output target of 405 mln
	tonnes against 391 mln in 1986.
	    "All areas must spare no effort to raise the autumn harvest
	area, especially of corn, sweet potatoes, paddy rice and
	high-yield cash crops," it said.
	    It added factory production might have to be reduced to
	provide electricity for agriculture if it was needed to fight
	the drought.
	    Since January, the press has devoted much attention to
	grain, stressing that growth in output is vital to China's
	economic and political stability and that prices paid to
	farmers are too low.
	    Officials in east China have repeatedly said stable grain
	production is a key state policy and outlined the measures
	being taken in their areas to encourage output.
	    The Shanghai official said that in one suburb, 10 pct of
	the pre-tax profits of factories are used to subsidise
	agriculture. He said rural industries in other suburbs also set
	aside money for grain and pay the salaries of some of the
	70,000 workers available to help farmers.
	    Chu Jinfeng, an official of Fengbing county outside
	Shanghai, said factory workers get 60 yuan a month and three
	years unpaid leave to grow grain and can keep the profits.
	    Pan Huashan, an official of the agricultural department of
	Zhejiang Province, said rural industry also subsidises grain
	output in his province.
	    "In addition, we are setting up grain production bases,
	raising the level of science and technology on the farms and
	improving the supply of raw materials, roads and other
	infrastructure," he said.
	    The Shanghai official said rural residents who work in
	industry or commerce usually keep their land to farm in their
	spare time, or let other family members farm it. In some cases,
	they lease the land to grain farmers.
	    The China Daily said last month that grain output should
	reach between 425 and 450 mln tonnes by 1990 and between 480
	and 500 mln by 2000. It said growing grain should be made
	profitable.
	    "The advantages the state promises grain growers actually
	yield tangible profits for them and are not siphoned off by
	intermediate agencies because of bureaucracy or corruption.
	Only this will boost enthusiasm," it said.

	ANALYST SAYS USSR WINTER GRAINS HURT BY WEATHER
TOPICS:
	grain, wheat, corn
PLACES:
	usa, ussr, canada, australia, argentina
CONTENT:
	The Soviet Union's winter grain
	crop is likely to have suffered losses due to dry planting
	conditions last fall and severe cold this winter, an analyst of
	world weather and crop conditions said.
	    Grain analyst and meteorologist Gail Martell, author of the
	EF Hutton publication "Global Crop News," said in her latest
	report that the Soviets may import more grain, possibly wheat,
	from the U.S. due to potential crop damage.
	    "Compared with last year, the outlook (for the Soviet
	winter grain crop) is far more pessimistic," she said. "But
	it's still too early to talk about disastrous losses. A lot
	will depend on spring weather, not only for the outcome of the
	troubled winter grain crop, but also for spring planting."
	    Martell said the dry weather conditions last fall probably
	prevented optimal seed germination for winter grains. Key wheat
	growing areas of the southern Ukraine and North Caucasus
	received on 25-35 pct of autumn precipitation, she said.
	    The bitter winter cold temperatures -- which broke record
	lows that had stood for four decades -- also may have taken its
	toll on Soviet winter crops, she said.
	    However, she noted that most of the southern grain belt had
	ample snow cover, which should have well-insulated the majority
	of crop areas from severe frost damage.
	    The USSR has already bought 20 to 21 mln tonnes of grains
	in the July 1986/June 1987 marketing year, primarily from
	Canada, the European Community, Argentina and Australia,
	Martell said.
	    She cited a number of reasons besides possible crop
	problems that might point to additional Soviet import demand.
	    Last fall's dry weather may limit livestock grazing on
	moisture-depleted pastures, while the cold winter weather
	necessitated supplemental feeding to keep livestock healthy.
	    Martell was also skeptical of a Soviet claim for a 1986
	grain harvest of 210 mln tonnes, and said the Chernobyl
	accident may have contaminated more grain than originally
	thought and have to be made up with imports.
	    However, she said the U.S. remains a supplier of last
	resort for the Soviet Union, noting that the Soviets have only
	just recently begun their first U.S. grain purchases of the
	1986/87 season by buying 2.25 mln tonnes of corn.
	    Martell cited USDA statistics showing that since the 1980
	grain embargo the U.S. is only a major supplier of grain to the
	USSR during years of heavy Soviet demand.
	    In 1984/85, the U.S. supplied 41 pct of record Soviet grain
	imports of 55.5 mln tonnes. But in 1985/86, the Soviet Union
	bought 29.9 mln tonnes of grain and turned to the U.S. for only
	24 pct of that total.
	    While the USDA Soviet import target for grain for 1986/87
	was 22 mln tonnes, many U.S. grain analysts have revised their
	estimates of Soviet imports up to 25-28 mln tonnes, she said.

	South Korea will cut import taxes on 50
	goods, including construction equipment, cigarettes and
	tobacco, to help reduce its trade surplus with the United
	States, the Finance Ministry said today. The tariff cuts of
	between five and 30 pct will take effect on July 1.
	    South Korea ran a trade surplus of 7.3 billion dlrs with
	Washington in 1986, sharply up from 4.3 billion in 1985.
	    Today's announcement brings to 157 the number of goods for
	which similar measures were taken this year, a ministry
	official said. The 157 are among about 290 items on which
	Washington has asked Seoul to lower tariffs.
	    "This is in line with the government's policy to limit our
	trade surplus with the United States to help reduce trade
	friction between the two countries," said the official.

	LOWER U.S. RICE STOCKS, STRONG EXPORTS - USDA
TOPICS:

PLACES:

CONTENT:
	Rising demand for U.S. rice may
	gradually reduce surpluses while a marketing loan should help
	increase the U.S. share of the world rice market despite
	sluggish trade this year, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
	    In its quarterly rice outlook and situation summary, the
	department said U.S. rice use may surpass production during the
	1986/87 marketing year, causing stocks to fall about 10 mln
	hundredweight from a year earlier to an estimated 67 mln cwt on
	July 31.
	    Long grain acreage as a percentage of total acreage is
	expected to decline this year, the report said.
	    USDA said factors once supportive of increased long grain
	acreage have turned around. Domestic prices of medium grain
	relative to long grain have increased, the loan differential
	has been greatly reduced and increases in long grain yields
	relative to those of other classes have leveled off.
	    With the drop in domestic prices resulting from the
	marketing loan, domestic rice use is expected to grow at a
	faster rate, USDA said.
	    "Development of new products and increased promotion have
	helped make rice more available and visible to a wider range of
	consumers," USDA said.
	    USDA said world trade is expected to fall in 1987 because
	of large production and stocks but a weaker market should
	affect competing exporters more than the U.S.
	    "The United States has already recovered a substantial share
	of the European Community market and made inroads into markets
	in the Middle East and Africa," the report said.
	    World rice consumption is projected to reach record levels
	in 1986/87, the report said, as higher per capita incomes,
	increased domestic production and low import prices have
	allowed people in many countries to substitute rice for coarse
	grains.
	    China, India and South Korea have increased output, while
	the Middle East and Africa have doubled imports since the
	mid-1970s, the report said.

	PHILIPPINES APPROVES NEW CAR PROGRAMME

CONTENT:
	Philippines' Board of Investments (BOI)
	has approved new guidelines on making cars but is still
	awaiting rules on the tax component of the programme, trade and
	industry secretary Jose Concepcion said.
	    He said the authorities were still deciding how much tax
	will be levied on locally-assembled cars.
	    The new car development programme replaces an earlier
	scheme and is designed to limit the number of car manufacturers
	in the local market.
	    The scheme is to be unveiled before the end of the month.
	    The two accredited local car manufacturers are <Pilipinas
	Nissan Inc>, which gets car kits from Nissan Motor Company Ltd
	<NSAN.T> and <Philippine Automotive Manufacturing Corp> which
	gets supplies from Mitsubishi Corp <MITT.T>.
	    Three companies which pulled out due to what they saw as
	poor market conditions were Ford Philippines, a subsidiary of
	Ford Motor Co <F>, General Motors Pilipinas, a subsidiary of
	General Motors Corp <GM> and <Delta Motors Corp>.
	    Toyota Motor Corp <TOYO.T>, which was the foreign partner
	of Delta Motors, has applied for a place in the new programme
	and is negotiating the purchase of Delta's assembly plant.
	    Concepcion declined to say how many car assemblers would be
	allowed to operate, but said they will be required to finance
	75 pct of the foreign exchange needed to import
	completely-knocked-down kits.
	    The balance will be provided by the central bank, he said.
	    The trade minister, who is also chairman of the BOI, said
	the programme is intended to develop a car parts industry by
	requiring car firms to use locally-made spare parts. He said
	the plan should keep car prices at "reasonable levels."
	    Tax currently accounts for 40 pct of the total cost of a
	car.

	FAR EAST TRADERS EXPECT 20 DLR OIL IN JANUARY
TOPICS:

CONTENT:
	OPEC's agreement to limit output to 16.6
	mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of the year should boost
	spot prices and enable the group to raise its official
	reference price to 20 dlrs a barrel in January from the current
	18 dlrs, Far East oil industry sources said.
	    "Fundamentally, the market situation is bullish and the
	official price will be 20 dlrs in January," a Japanese refiner
	said.
	    The sources said that in spite of over-production by OPEC
	members such as Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and
	Qatar, demand should exceed supply by the fourth quarter.
	    Spot oil prices surged on Friday in late U.S. Trading as
	the market anticipated an OPEC agreement on second-half 1987
	output. In early Tokyo trade, levels were firm at 17.30 dlrs
	for Mideast Dubai cargoes loading next month and 19.00 dlrs for
	U.K. Brent, traders said.
	    They said they expect more foreign crudes to be sucked into
	the U.S. Market as the benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate
	(WTI) trades at around 20.30 dlrs.
	    "With WTI at 20, 21 or 22 dlrs, U.S. Refiners will import
	Mideast and Far East crudes and this will strengthen those
	grades further," said a Japanese oil trader.
	    Some Tokyo traders were cautious about whether thU spot
	market has further upward potential in the short term, having
	risen strongly on the OPEC news on Friday.
	    "You could certainly argue that if New York rose on that
	basis, there's no reason for prices to go up again today," said
	one international oil trader in Tokyo.
	    "But I think if there's any sign of a dip, it will be bought
	back up again pretty quickly," he added.
	    One oil industry analyst concurred, "There is no reason to
	expect a weak market from now on." He said he expected OPEC to
	raise prices to 20 dlrs when it meets on December 9.
	    Oil sources said spot prices are unlikely to surge strongly
	in the next few months due to cheating by some OPEC members and
	the likelihood that Saudi Arabia will act as swing producer to
	maintain steady prices.
	    Iraq is currently producing around two mln barrels per day
	compared to its second-half quota of 1.54 mln, they said. Its
	export capability will rise to 2.5 mln bpd when a new pipeline
	through Turkey, comes onstream in or around September.
	    Qatar is said to be achieving sales of around 350,000 bpd,
	against its OPEC-assigned quota of 299,000, by discounting up
	to 20 cents a barrel from official prices, the sources said.
	    Iran, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait are also cheating
	on the OPEC agreement with over-production and effective price
	discounts through counter-purchases, industry sources said. But
	they mostly agreed that Saudi Arabia will unofficially act as
	swing producer, cutting production to compensate for higher
	output by other members or boosting output if spot prices rise
	too high too fast.
	    Saudi Arabia has a floating oil stockpile of 40 to 50 mln
	barrels. "Saudi Arabia wants oil price stability so the
	stockpile may be utilized to cool down the market if it rises
	too much," an oil industry analyst said.
