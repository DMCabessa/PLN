	SYDNEY FINANCIAL FUTURES CLOSE MIXED

PLACES:
	
CONTENT:
	Exhausted buyers and a late fall on the
	Australian share market due to profit-taking led to a sharp
	drop in share price index contracts on the Sydney Futures
	Exchange, dealers said.
	    Domestic credit futures were mixed, with 90-day bank bills
	firming in line with easier physical yields as the dollar rose,
	they said. Ten-year bond futures, however, were steady on the
	day's open in line with little changed physical yields.
	    Comex-linked gold futures were higher on rises in bullion,
	while international credit futures were mixed in extremely thin
	trade.
	    June share price index futures closed at 1735.5 from the
	day's 1754.0 open, well off yesterday's record 1748.5 close.
	September was also well down on 1737.0 from 1763.0 after
	finishing at 1746.0 yesterday. About 3,154 lots were traded.
	    Dealers said the momentum of the futures market appeared to
	be exhausted, with a return to bigger discounts now likely.
	    Demand for gold and industrial stock continued to drive up
	the all ordinaries index, which climbed 8.5 points to 1754.8,
	although this was well off the day's highs after late
	profit-taking.
	    Easier physical yields, as a result of the firmer
	Australian dollar, also saw rises in 90-day bank bill futures.
	June contracts rose to 85.16 from the day's 85.00 open in
	active trade after falling to a low of 84.96. September rose to
	85.25 from 85.12 after finishing yesterday at 85.20. About
	6,912 contracts were traded.
	    Physical yields eased to 15.48/53 pct from 15.60.
	    June 10-year bond futures, the only month to trade, were
	steady on the day's 86.87 open after closing yesterday at
	86.96. About 7,041 lots were exchanged.
	    Physical March 1997 paper was 13.11/14 pct from 13.14.
	    June Comex-linked gold futures finished strongly at 425.00
	U.S. Dlrs an ounce from the day's 423.20 open and overnight
	close of 422.60 in line with strong gains in bullion. Only nine
	lots were traded.
	    International credit futures were mixed, with June U.S.
	T-bonds finishing lower at 97.27 from the day's 97.30 start,
	well off the overnight Chicago close of 98.04. The contract was
	untraded locally yesterday.
	    June Eurodollars were untraded on a buy/sell quote of
	93.31/36 after finishing at 93.35 in Chicago from a local close
	yesterday of 93.36.

	MARKET WELCOMES LOWER AUSTRALIAN PAYMENTS DEFICIT
TOPICS:

PLACES:
	australia
CONTENT:
	The Australian dollar rose more than 40
	points and money market interest rates retreated on the better
	than expected improvement in the February current account
	deficit, but economists and dealers were cautious about
	identifying it as the start of a downward trend.
	    The current account deficit narrowed to 750 mln dlrs in
	February from 1.23 billion in January. It hit 13.82 billion
	dlrs in 1985/86 to end-June.
	    The currency jumped to 0.6858/63 U.S. Dlrs and traded as
	high as 0.6875 before retreating to around 0.6864/69.
	    "It's got 69 cents written all over it," one dealer said.
	    Foreign exchange dealers said some buyers had gone long on
	the dollar expecting a lower figure and sold it down about 30
	points to 0.6820 U.S. Dlrs before the release.
	    The 750 mln dlr deficit was at the lower end of forecasts
	and analysts said the market would welcome any figure below one
	billion dlrs for March.
	    Banque National de Paris <BNPP.A> senior dealer Peter
	Nicolls cautioned that in the long term the currency and
	interest rates were too high for import substitution and export
	industries.
	    Nicolls said he expected the dollar to go as high as 0.6875
	and perhaps to 69 cents tomorrow.
	    <Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd> chief economist Will Buttrose said
	the 42 mln dlr trade surplus was encouraging as were imports at
	2.77 billion dlrs, down from 2.99 billion in January.
	    But he warned that the outlook for rural and iron and coal
	exports remained poor. "We should remember we are paying
	something like seven to eight billion dollars simply to service
	our foreign debt and that is not going to go away in the near
	term," Buttrose said.
	    Buttrose said he expected a March deficit of around 900 mln
	dlrs, and added "Any figure under a billion dollars will be
	acceptable (to the markets)."
	    ANZ Banking Group Ltd <ANZA.S> senior economist Ian Little
	said the big question was whether the improvement in exports
	could be sustained. February FOB exports rose to 2.82 billion
	dlrs from a revised 2.74 billion in January.
	    Interest rates responded quickly to the deficit news, with
	90-day bank bill yields falling to 16.42-16.45 pct from early
	highs of 16.50 and yields yesterday as high as 16.65.
	    Longer term yields fell with 10-year bonds at 13.66/68 pct
	from 13.74 before the release and highs of 13.87 yesterday.
	    The stock market was easier at midsession but brokers said
	the current account data had little impact on trading.

	AFTER G-6, ROUND ONE GOES TO CENTRAL BANKS
TOPICS:
	money-fx
PLACES:
	usa
CONTENT:
	Central banks have easily beaten back
	the foreign exchange market's first test of the industrialized
	nations' recent pact to stabilize currencies, analysts said.
	    In active trading this week, the market pushed the dollar,
	sterling, the Canadian dollar and Australian dollar higher. But
	operators got their fingers burned as one by one the central
	banks signalled their displeasure.
	    "So far G-6 has been a roaring success,"said James O'Neill,
	financial markets economist at Marine Midland Bank NA.
	    "The central banks are sending strong signals that they
	won't tolerate any kind of momentum building behind
	currencies," added a senior corporate trader at one U.K. bank.
	    On February 22, the finance ministers and central bank
	governors of the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France and the U.K.
	-- the Group of Five -- plus Canada, signed an accord under
	which they agreed to cooperate closely to foster stability of
	exchange rates around prevailing levels.
	    The agreement was viewed by many in the market as an
	attempt to put a floor under the dollar after its sizeable
	two-year decline against major world currencies.
	    And initially, traders indicated their respect for the
	accord by refraining from pushing the dollar lower.
	    But by Wednesday, the dollar climbed to more than 1.87
	marks, about five pfennigs above its levels the Friday before
	the G-6 accord.
	    The move was aided by indications that the U.S. economy
	picked up steam in February at the same time as the West German
	economy was regressing.
	    But dealers said the Federal Reserve Bank of New York gave
	traders a sharp reminder that the G-6 pact had encompassed the
	idea of limiting inordinate dollar gains as well as declines.
	    Dealers differed as to whether the U.S. central bank
	actually intervened to sell dollars above 1.87 marks, or simply
	telephoned dealers to ask for quotes and enquire about trading
	conditions.
	    But the dollar quickly backed off. It hovered today around
	1.85 marks. "The market was surprised that the Fed showed its
	face so soon," said Marine Midland NA's O'Neill.
	    Also on Wednesday, London dealers said the Bank of England
	intervened in the open market to sell sterling as the U.K.
	currency rose to 1.60 dlrs compared with 1.5355 dlrs before the
	G-6 pact.
	    Sterling, along with the other high-yield currencies like
	the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, was in favor after
	traders surmised that the the chance of intervention pursuant
	to the Paris currency accord left limited room for profit plays
	on dollar/mark and dollar/yen.
	    The pound also was boosted by suggestions of an improving
	U.K. economy, anticipation of a popular British budget on March
	17 and public opinion polls showing good chances for the
	incumbent Conservative party in any general election.
	    "There was a real run on sterling," said Anne Mills of
	Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
	    Sterling traded today around 1.5750 dlrs, down from 1.5870
	dlrs last night. It slid to 2.917 marks from 2.950 yesterday
	and from a peak of about 2.98 recently. "There's been some
	heavy profit-taking on sterling/mark ahead of next Tuesday's
	U.K. budget," said James McGroarty of Discount Corp.
	    As speculators detected the presence of the U.S. and
	British central banks, they acclerated their shift into
	Canadian and Australian dollars. But here too they were
	stymied. The Bank of Canada acted to slow its currency's rise.
	    The Canadian dollar traded at 1.3218/23 per U.S. dollar
	today, down from 1.3185/90 yesterday.
	    And the Australian Reserve Bank, using the Fed as agent,
	sold Australian dollars in the U.S. yesterday, dealers said.
	    The Australian dollar fell to a low of 67.45/55 U.S. cents
	today from a high of 69.02 Thursday.
	    Analysts said the central banks' moves to stifle sudden
	upward movement, leave the market uncertain about its next
	step. Today, the focus shifted to the yen which has held to a
	very tight range against the dollar for several months.
	    The dollar fell to 152.35/40 yen from 153.35/40 last night.
	Analysts said the yen also gained as traders unwound long
	sterling/short mark positions established lately.
	    "Because of the change in perceptions about the health of
	the German economy, the funds from those unwinding operations
	are ending up in yen," a dealer at one U.K. bank said.
	    Recent West German data have shown falling industry orders,
	lower industrial output and slowing employment gains.
	    Moreover, the yen is benefitting as Japanese entities who
	have invested heavily overseas, for example in Australian
	financial instruments, repatriate their profits ahead of the
	end of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31.
	    Noting that the dollar/yen rate is in a sense the most
	controversial one because of the large U.S. trade deficit with
	Japan, analysts said the stage could be set for another test of
	the dollar's downward scope against the Japanese currency.
	    In its latest review of the foreign exchange market through
	the end of January, the Federal Reserve revealed that it
	intervened to protect the dollar against the yen on January 28.
	On that day, the dollar fell as low as 150.40 yen.
	    "Sure, the Fed bought dollars near the 150 yen level in
	January. But the market has to bear in mind that time marches
	on and the situation changes," said McGroarty of Discount.

	LONDON EURODOLLAR BONDS CLOSE LOWER
TOPICS:
	
PLACES:
	uk
CONTENT:
	Eurodollar bonds closed as much as a full
	point lower as the dollar fell to a post-war low against the
	yen and interest rates on U.S. Treasuries rose almost to eight
	pct.
	    The dollar fell to 144.30 yen and recovered only slightly
	after foreign exchange traders in New York said the Federal
	Reserve intervened to buy dollars for yen.
	    But despite the dollar's woes, Japan Development Bank,
	wholly owned by the Japanese government, raised 150 mln dlrs in
	a seven-year eurobond carrying an eight pct coupon.
	    Lead manager for the issue, Bank of Tokyo, said the deal,
	at the time of pricing, was to yield 60 basis points over
	comparable maturity Treasuries. However, by the close of
	trading, that spread had narrowed to 55 and continued to slide
	in aftermarket activity.
	    Dealers noted that the spread to Treasuries is wide for a
	newly-priced AAA-rated borrower like Japan Development Bank.
	For example, earlier this week, the World Bank raised U.S. Dlrs
	at only 25 basis points over Treasuries. Dealers said that
	because the borrower comes to market fairly infrequently -- the
	last time was about nine months ago, the spread appears wide.
	    But officials at Bank of Tokyo said the spread is intended
	to compensate for the lack of liquidity and for the uncertainty
	currently associated with owning dollar securities.
	    The officials said the borrower opted to raise funds in
	dollars, despite the currency's weakness, because it is the
	only market deep enough to accommodate an issue of that size.
	Japan Development Bank is not allowed to raise euroyen.
	    Market sources said the deal is likely to be swapped into
	yen as the borrowers previous issues were.
	    Late in the day, the deal was trading just inside its fees
	at less 1.75 less 1.55.
	    Also issued today was a 40 mln dlr five-year offering from
	Toshiba International Finance (Netherlands) carrying a 7-3/8
	pct coupon and priced at 101-1/2.
	    Three equity linked dollar denominated deals were offered,
	the largest of which was a 200 mln dlr offering by Sekisui
	Chemical Co and guaranteed by Sanwa Bank Ltd. The issue has
	equity warrants attached and late in the day it was quoted on
	brokers' screens at 106-1/2, bid only.
	    The Australian dollar market continued active, with
	Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce offering a bond of 125 mln
	five-year with a zero coupon priced at 54.
	    Late in the day, the deal was quoted at less 1-1/4 bid. A
	similar deal yesterday by Toronto Dominion, priced slightly
	higher at 54.37 pct for an effective yield of 13.52 pct, was
	quoted slightly lower at less 1.37 less 1.25 pct.
	    Dealers said that investors are apparently willing to
	accept zero-coupon bonds yielding 50 to 100 basis points less
	than annual-pay bonds because their are tax benefits for retail
	buyers. Also, the bonds are more volatile and if interest rates
	fall in Australia as many analysts expect, the potential for
	capital gains is greater with a zero-coupon. The bonds are also
	better for those who expect the australian dlr to appreciate.
	    Dealers said that the Australia dlr zero coupon bonds are
	apparently being placed with retail accounts on the European
	continent with very little placement being done in Japan.
	    Euroyen issues sank slightly in line with prices on
	domestic Japanese bond markets but recovered in late trade as
	the yen soared. After the markets closed, the dollar fell to
	144 yen.
	    The European Investment Bank (EIB) issued a 40 mln euroyen
	issue paying 4-5/8 pct over seven years. This is the second
	seven-year yen issue in two days -- a sector of the yield curve
	in Japan that dealers feel has not yet become overpriced.

	NEW LME ALUMINIUM CONTRACT WELCOMED BY TRADE
TOPICS:
	alum
PLACES:
	uk, singapore
CONTENT:
	The London Metal Exchange's, LME,
	decision to introduce a dollar-denominated aluminium contract,
	with the Port of Singapore listed as a delivery point, is a
	positive move, physical traders and LME dealers said.
	    Earlier this week the LME declared that a 99.70 pct minimum
	purity aluminium contract would commence trading on June 1,
	1987, alongside its long-established sterling-based 99.50 pct
	contract.
	    This is the LME's first dollar contract and non-European
	delivery point, and the Board and Committee are looking at
	Singapore as a delivery point for other contracts.
	    Trade sources said the LME's new contract will conform with
	existing industry practice, where 99.70 standard re-melt
	material, priced in dollars, is most commonly traded.
	    The location of a warehouse in Singapore is also a positive
	move by the LME, given its ideal location for Australian and
	Japanese traders, who would be able to place metal on to
	warrant speedily and relatively inexpensively, they said.
	    Hedging during the LME ring sessions becomes much simpler
	with a dollar contract. At present pre-market trading is almost
	exclusively dollar-based, but currency conversions have to be
	done during the sterling rings, they added.
	    LME ring dealers said the new contract would match more
	closely trade requirements and possibly alleviate some of the
	recent wide backwardations.
	    Very little physical business is now done in 99.50 pct
	purity metal, nearly all of which is produced in Eastern Bloc
	countries, such as Romania.
	    The Soviet Union also produces 99.50 pct, but has declined
	as an exporter recently, they said.
	    Some dealers said the new 99.70 contract may suffer from
	liquidity problems initially, as business may continue to
	centre on the present good ordinary brand (gob) contract, where
	there are many holders of large short positions on the LME.
	    But others said the new contract would soon attract trading
	interest, given that much 99.70 metal has already been
	attracted to the LME's warehouses by backwardations.
	    The LME also has a much more viable liquidity base for a
	new contract, compared to the Comex market in New York, where
	high grade aluminium futures are not particularly active, they
	said.
	    Thus, it seems likely that the sterling contract will
	eventually lose trading interest and volumes will decline. Like
	standard zinc, which was superseded by a high grade contract,
	gob aluminium will probably be replaced, although the process
	in this case may take longer, they added.
	    Forming a new contract and establishing a Singapore
	warehouse are constructive moves by the LME but backwardations,
	which make physical trading difficult, would not totally
	disappear as a result, the trade sources said.
	    These premiums for prompt metal have become a
	semi-permanent feature over the last year, due to increased
	business and volatility in traded options, and are presently
	around 50 stg.
	    Increasingly large granting of option positions has been
	taking place. When some of these are declared and exercised at
	the end of the relevant month, physical tightness and squeezes
	around these dates are commonplace, they said.
	    Listing Singapore as a delivery point allows Far Eastern
	operators to deliver aluminium into a LME warehouse instead of
	having to cover.
	    But tightness and backwardations are seen continuing, even
	though the LME's new option contracts widen the gap between the
	declaration and prompt dates.
	    These will be due on the first and third Wednesday of the
	month, whereas at present most fall on the 20th and 25th.
	    Backwardations will remain while operators continue to
	grant options where potential tonnage to be delivered exceeds
	aluminium stock levels, an LME option trader said.

	DOLLAR STRAIGHT BONDS END LOWER, TEXACO UNTRADED
TOPICS:
	
PLACES:

CONTENT:
	The dollar straight sector of the
	eurobond market ended lower after another nervous day's
	trading, with many operators keeping to the sidelines ahead of
	tomorrow's U.S. Trade figures for February, dealers said.
	Prices of longer dated issues ended 1/2 or 5/8 point lower,
	while short dates were 1/8 to 3/8 point easier.
	    Bonds for Texaco Inc units hardly traded during the day
	following the weekend news that the company filed for Chapter
	11 bankruptcy protection in another twist to its long running
	dispute with Pennzoil Co, dealers added.
	    The Chapter 11 filing means that Texaco will not be paying
	interest on its eurobonds. Dealers in the straight bonds noted
	that the market in them had been basis only for some time prior
	to the weekend's news. "It wasn't a true market, someone asked
	you a price and you just gave them an idea," one said.
	    However, the company's convertible bonds had been trading
	since the company's share price provided a benchmark to which
	dealers could establish a proper price level. The company has
	two actively traded convertibles outstanding, a 500 mln dlr
	bond due 1994 which pays 11-3/4 pct and a one billion dlr deal,
	also due 1994, paying 11-7/8 pct.
	    Traders even disagreed about last week's closing levels for
	the convertible bonds, but a median appeared to be around 97 to
	99 pct. Today, one trader said they were indicated initially at
	65 to 70 pct before ending at some 79 83 pct.
	    But he added, "That's only an idea. There's no real market
	today. I've dealt once during the day, I'm not going to say at
	what level." Other dealers were reluctant even to give an
	indication of the bonds' levels.
	    Dealers said the market in all Texaco deals will almost
	certainly remain on an indicated, or negotiated, basis until
	the events of the weekend are further clarified.
	    The primary market had a steady day, with the Australian
	dollar and the yen sectors again seeing the most activity,
	dealers said. Deutsche Bank Finance NV Curacao became the first
	of three issuers in the Australian dollar market during the
	morning with a 100 mln dlr bond due 1990 paying 14-1/8 pct and
	priced at 100-1/4 pct.
	    The issue was lead managed by Deutsche Bank Capital Markets
	(DBCM) and guaranteed by Deutsche Bank itself. A DBCM official
	said the firm had placed 60 mln Australian dlrs of the issue
	itself and quoted the deal at less one less 7/8 pct,
	comfortably inside the 1-1/2 pct total fees.
	    The State Bank of Victoria issued a 50 mln Australian dlr
	bond paying 14-1/2 pct over three years and priced at 101-3/8
	pct. Commerzbank AG was sole manager for the deal, which was
	offered on one broker screen at less 1-1/2 pct.
	    The day's other borrower in this sector was the New South
	Wales Treasury Corporation guaranteed by the crown-in-right of
	New South Wales. The five year bond pays 14-1/4 pct and was
	priced at 101-7/8 pct.
	    Lead manager was County Natwest Capital Markets. It was
	quoted at less 1-7/8 less 1-3/4 pct, inside the two pct total
	fees.
	    Secondary market Australian dlr bonds ended little changed
	on the day, with dealers saying that operators are awaiting the
	Australian trade figures for March. A deficit of some 800 mln
	to one billion dlrs was expected by one house active in the
	sector.
	    Union Bank of Switzerland (Securities) Ltd lead managed a
	15 billion yen bond for Union Bank of Switzerland NV. The five
	year deal pays 4-3/8 pct and features a put and call option at
	par after four years.
	    Priced at 101-5/8 pct, the issue was quoted at less 1-1/4
	pct bid on the grey market compared with the total fees of
	1-5/8 pct.
	    Ente Nazionale per l'Energia Elettrica issued a 15 billion
	yen bond due 1994 at 4-3/4 pct and priced at 101-7/8 pct. The
	deal was quoted on the 1-7/8 pct total fees.
	    Elsewhere, Alza Corp issued a 75 mln dlr convertible bond
	due 2002 through Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. The par priced
	issue has an indicated coupon of between 5-1/2 and 5-3/4 pct.

	DOLLAR EUROBONDS END EASIER ON PRIME RATE RISES
TOPICS:

	The dollar straight sector of the
	eurobond market ended easier after a subdued day's trading as
	U.S. Banks began to match yesterday's surprise 1/4 point prime
	rate hikes by Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank, dealers said.
	    The prime rates were raised to 7-3/4 from 7-1/2 pct and the
	timing of the moves puzzled many dealers. However, reaction
	here was limited, with shorter dated paper ending steady to 1/4

	    In the primary market, activity again centred on currencies
	other than the U.S. Dollar, dealers noted.
	    One dollar straight dealer at a U.S. Securities house
	commented "There was, in fact, the odd retail buyer today, but

	has been the case recently, equity linked. The 15-year
	convertible bond was for the Bank of Tokyo Ltd and has an
	indicated coupon of two pct. One source at a house involved in
	the deal said, "It's got to be a blow-out. With a name like this
	you're talking about Japan Inc."
	    The lead manager was the Bank of Tokyo International (BOTI)
	and the deal ended far above the par issue price at 108 109
	pct. A BOTI official said "We've had worldwide interest in the
	deal."
	    She noted the Tokyo stock market had experienced a mild
	correction at the beginning of the week but that bank stocks
	were hardly affected.
	    The yen sector edged slightly firmer and one new straight
	deal was launched, a 20 billion yen bond for France's Caisse
	Nationale des Telecommunications. The state guaranteed five
	year bond pays 4-3/8 pct and was priced at 101-1/2 pct.
	    The issue was lead managed by IBJ International Ltd and was
	quoted on the grey market at less 1-7/8 less 1-3/4 pct compared
	with the total fees of 1-7/8 pct. One syndicate official at a
	firm not involved in the deal said "It's tight, but overall I
	would say its fairly priced."
	    Also launched was a five-year zero coupon bond with a total
	redemption amount of 19 billion yen for Rural Banking and
	Finance Corp of New Zealand. It was priced at 81.22 pct and
	lead managed by Nomura International.
	    In the Australian dollar sector, GMAC (Australia) Finance
	Ltd issued a 50 mln Australian dlr bond.
	    Hambros Bank Ltd was lead manager for the four-year deal
	which pays 14-1/4 pct and was priced at 101 pct. It was
	guranteed by General Motors Acceptance Corp and was quoted on
	the 1-3/4 pct fees at less 1-3/4 pct bid.
	    McDonalds Corp issued a 75 mln Canadian dlr bond paying
	8-1/2 pct over five years and priced at 101-5/8 pct. It was
	quoted around the 1-7/8 pct fees at less two less 1-3/4 and was
	led by Morgan Guaranty Ltd.
	    The European Investment Bank launched a 300 mln Danish
	Crown, seven-year, bond withan 11 pct coupon and pricing of 101
	pct. It was lead managed by Den Danske Bank.
	    The floating rate note sector basically ended easier
	following the increase in period eurodollar deposit rates
	prompted by the prime rate increases, dealers said. But they
	noted that mis-match deals - issues whereby the coupon is
	re-fixed on a monthly basis - were firmer.

	EUROBOND MARKET GENERALLY FIRMER WHERE CHANGED

	Secondary sectors of the eurobond market,
	where changed, were generally firmer in quiet morning trading
	with attention again tending to focus on currencies other than
	the dollar, dealers said.
	    The sterling straight market opened with further gains of
	1/8 or 1/4 point with sentiment boosted by the publication of
	two more opinion polls showing the ruling Conservative Party
	with a substantial lead over opposition parties.
	    Dealers said operators seem a little more cautious this
	morning since profit-taking is expected to emerge soon after
	recent substantial gains.
	    The dollar straight sector was little changed with
	yesterday's gains on the U.S. Bond market being balanced out by
	a slightly easier dollar. The market is now awaiting news which
	may emerge from tomorrow's Group of Seven meeting in
	Washington.
	    "It's not often you can call the dollar straight sector a
	backwater in the market but that's what it is at the moment," a
	head trader at a U.S. Firm said.
	    U.S. Treasury security trading was also quiet with retail
	participation limited to enquiry, dealers said. The 30-year
	long bond was quoted at 95-30/32 pct at 0845 GMT.
	    The yen and Australian dollar sectors remained buoyant
	although volume was lower than yesterday morning, dealers said.
	Yen bonds were 1/4 to 3/8 point firmer with initial buying
	coming from the Far East, dealers said.
	    The market was boosted by a very firm Japanese bond market
	in which the yield on the key 5.1 pct bond due 1996 dropped to
	close at 3.905 pct compared with yesterday's close of 3.955
	pct.
	    In the Australian dollar market there was some retail
	demand for zero coupon bonds, dealers said.

	said it was preparing a 500 mln dlr commercial paper facility
	aimed at establishing a new Australian dollar denominated paper
	market in Asia.
	    Commonwealth senior manager Graham Hand told Reuters the
	facility was the first in a program modelled on the U.S.
	Commercial paper market.
	    Hand said the bank was still putting together its dealing
	panel and would begin discussing the facility with potential
	customers in Hong Kong, Singapore and Tokyo next month. It
	hoped to launch the facility soon afterwards, he said.
	    The paper would be investor driven with the bank gauging
	demand through the dealing panel which would also offer a
	liquid secondary market, Hand said.
	    For flexibility the bank would post yields daily to dealers
	on an absolute rate basis providing a range of short term
	maturities. The paper would be issued at a discount and
	guaranteed by the Australian government, Hand said.

	A sharp overnight fall on Wall Street due
	to profit taking and arbitrage related selling and a subsequent
	local share market slump led to a steep drop in most share
	price index contracts, dealers said.
	    They said domestic credit futures were higher, however, in
	response to lower yields in short term money markets as the
	Australian dollar firmed and cash weakened.
	    Comex-linked gold futures were higher as a result of rises
	in bullion. International credit futures were steady in
	extremely thin trade.
	    June share price index futures opened lower at 1,730.0
	against yesterday's 1,735.5 close in moderate trade. September
	was slightly higher at 1,741.0 against 1,737.0 in thin trade.
	About 950 lots changed hands.
	    Dealers said the market, which seemed to lose its momentum
	late yesterday, reacted badly to the 45 point drop in the Dow
	Jones index. The all ordinaries index dropped 10.3 points to
	1,743.7 at mid-morning with losses across the board.
	    June 90 day bank bills rose to 85.23 from yesterday's 85.16
	close. September rose to 85.32 from 85.25. About 3,054
	contracts were traded.
	    Physical yields eased to 15.40 pct from 15.50.
	    June 10-year bond futures, the only month to trade, were
	higher at 86.92 against yesterday's 86.87 finish. About 5,433
	lots were exchanged.
	    March 1997 paper was 13.09 pct, down from 13.11.
	   June Comex-linked gold futures started strongly at 427.50
	U.S. Dlrs an ounce, up from 426.20 in New York and yesterday's
	close of 425.00. Only two lots were traded.
	    June U.S. T-bonds started at 97.02, down from a Chicago

	Eurodollars were steady with only five lots exchanged.

	AUSTRALIAN COAL EXPORTERS FACE TOUGH JAPAN TALKS

	Australian coal industry sources said
	Japanese electricity utilities are demanding price cuts in
	annual coal contract negotiations underway in Tokyo.
	    But the sources said they were unable to substantiate
	reports here that one of the largest steaming coal customers
	<Chugoku Electric Power Co Inc> threatened to stop taking
	deliveries until new prices are set.
	    Coal exporters want to maintain last year's 32 U.S. Dlrs a
	tonne price, which expired at the end of Japan's fiscal year on
	March 31, while the Japanese want to pay no more than the 27-28
	U.S. Dlrs secured with China and South Africa.
	    Ross McKinnon, general manager of <Thiess Dampier Mitsui
	Coal Pty Ltd>, which annually exports about one mln tonnes of
	steaming coal to Japan, mainly to Chugoku, told Reuters he had
	not been informed of any refusal to take shipments.
	    McKinnon said he could not recall when a Japanese contract
	had been settled before the previous one had expired, and said
	"controlled leaks" were commonplace during talks.
	    But Australian foreign currency markets took the reports
	seriously enough for dealers to say it added nervousness to
	trading, with the local dollar settling on 0.7080 U.S. Cents at
	midsession against its 0.7120 opening.
	    Coal was Australia's largest single export in the fiscal
	year ended June 30, 1986 with shipments reaching 90.49 mln
	tonnes worth 5.21 billion dlrs, or 15.9 pct of total exports.
	    Japan is the largest customer for the crucial steaming coal
	sector and took 14.97 mln tonnes of total exports of 43.3 mln
	tonnes in calendar 1986.
	    Sydney resources analyst Ian Story said the appreciation of
	the Australian dollar against the U.S. Currency meant steaming
	coal exporters were now receiving just 44.72 dlrs a tonne
	against 52.42 dlrs when last year's contract was negotiated.

	AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR CLOSES ABOVE LOWER OPENING LEVEL
TOPICS:

CONTENT:
	The Australian dollar staged a strong
	recovery on the local market after sharp overnight falls
	offshore, as a weak U.S. Dollar and capital inflow into local
	gold stocks and securities boosted demand, dealers said.
	    The dollar closed at 0.7092/97 U.S. Dlrs, after opening
	easier at 0.7040/45 from U.S. Lows of 0.7030/40. But the dollar
	still had not recovered to yesterday's local closing levels of
	0.7109/14.
	    Traders are confident the local unit will return above
	0.7100, and they regard today's fall as a correction in the
	currency's recent uptrend.
	    Traders said the Australian dollar, after trading around
	0.7040/50 for most of the day, surged to its day's high in late
	afternoon trading on Asian buying.
	    They said offshore traders are still bullish towards the
	Australian dollar as yesterday's U.S. Selling occurred in thin
	volume.
	    Nervousness over the short-term direction of the U.S.
	Dollar ahead of the International Monetary Fund meeting also
	provided support for the Australian dollar. In Asia, the U.S.
	Dollar ended lower at 145.15/20 yen against Tokyo's 145.25
	close and New York's final 145.85/90.
	    The U.S. Dollar also finished at 1.8208/18 marks against
	Tokyo's 1.8205/15 and 1.8260/70 in New York.
	    The Reserve Bank trade weighted index eased to 55.7 points
	from yesterday's 56.0. The U.S. Dollar average hedge settlement
	rate was struck at 70.66 from 71.10.
