	ZIMBABWE MAIZE OUTPUT TO FALL 65 PCT
TOPICS:

PLACES:
	zimbabwe
CONTENT:
	Maize deliveries to Zimbabwe's
	state-owned Grain Marketing Board (GMB) will fall by over 65
	pct this year, following a prolonged dry spell, agricultural
	industry sources said.
	    They said 1987 maize deliveries are expected to decline to
	around 520,000 tonnes from 1.6 mln tonnes last year. About 60
	pct of the maize will be delivered by large-scale commercial
	farmers and the balance by small-scale peasant producers.
	    Although this will be the lowest level of maize deliveries
	since 1980, the sources said there is no danger of a food
	shortage in Zimbabwe.
	    While annual maize consumption is estimated at 750,000
	tonnes, the GMB stockpile is currently around 1.8 mln tonnes,
	which means that even with the sharply reduced production this
	year Zimbabwe has enough maize for the next three years.
	    The sources said the lower maize crop would be offset by a
	25 pct increase in cotton production to 315,000 tonnes from
	248,000 tonnes last year, and by a rise of 20 pct in soybean
	deliveries to 100,000 tonnes from 84,000 tonnes in 1986.

	ZIMBABWE'S MAIZE MOUNTAIN POSES ECONOMIC PROBLEM
TOPICS:
	
PLACES:
	
CONTENT:
	More than two mln tonnes of surplus maize
	dotted across Zimbabwe in huge piles is posing an economic
	headache for the country.
	    The grain, Southern Africa's staple, has been bought by the
	Grain Marketing Board (GMB) at prices guaranteed before it was
	planted, and is costing the GMB about 27 mln dlrs a month in
	storage and interest payments to make the purchases.
	    Accumulated over the past two years of bumper harvests, the
	surplus represents about two years of domestic consumption and
	is set to grow as further deliveries are due shortly.
	    Some deals have been made with aid donors, such as European
	countries and Australia, to provide Zimbabwe with wheat in
	return for maize sent to neighbouring Mozambique, where the
	United Nations has urged greater world efforts to feed the
	hungry.
	    But transport constraints keep those figures low and the
	only significant dent was a sale of 250,000 tonnes to South
	Africa last year.
	    Because of the costs it has incurred, the GMB cannot afford
	to give the maize away and the standard 90 kg bags have been
	accumulating, economists here said.
	    But failure to find buyers on glutted world grain markets
	is damaging Zimbabwe, as it needs foreign exchange to finance
	imports for other areas of the economy, the economists added.
	    "At present, it is a no-win situation. Let us hope some of
	the extra aid (UN) Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar
	called for at the weekend will be spent here," a Western aid
	specialist said.
	    "At least this year's poor rains haven't exacerbated the
	situation too badly," he added. Rainfall during the current
	rainy season has been far below average, ravaging all but the
	irrigated lands of large commercial farmers.
	    While this may curb the amount of maize delivered this year
	to the GMB, the government also acted late last year to slash
	maize production and force diversification.
	    Calling for a switch to other crops such as oilseeds,
	Agriculture Minister Moven Mahachi said an economically-viable
	price of 180 dlrs a tonne would be paid this year for only half
	the amount of maize bought by the GMB in 1986, and above that
	growers would be paid an unprofitable 100 dlrs.
	    The poor rains have also adversely affected other crops,
	such as sorghum, soybeans, groundnuts, tobacco and cotton, the
	Agriculture Ministry reported at the end of February.

	DISEASE PUTS ZIMBABWE BEEF EXPORTS IN JEOPARDY
TOPICS:

CONTENT:
	Zimbabwe's beef exports to the European
	Community (EC), potentially worth 70 mln Zimbabwean dlrs this
	year, may be jeopardised by an outbreak of foot and mouth
	disease in southwestern Matabeleland, industry sources said.
	    The country has temporarily suspended beef exports to the
	EC because of the outbreak and awaits a decision from the EC
	veterinary committee, which is considering a formal ban.
	    The outbreak in the country's main ranching province has
	already led neighbouring beef-producing Botswana and Zambia to
	bar beef and dairy imports from Zimbabwe, threatening the dairy
	industry with a loss of at least one mln dlrs in export
	revenue.
	    "The situation is still uncertain at the moment. Normally
	when an outbreak occurs there is an automatic suspension of
	beef exports," one industry source said yesterday.
	     Commenting on EC policy, he explained, "Depending on the
	seriousness of the outbreak the (veterinary) committee then
	decides on three options, allowing us to continue exporting
	beef from disease-free areas, clamping a three-month suspension
	on exports or banning us from exporting for a year. We are
	still awaiting their decision," he added, asking not to be
	identified.
	    Zimbabwe was granted an export quota of 8,100 tonnes of
	high-grade beef to EC markets in 1985 after the country had
	spent millions of dollars erecting disease-control fences and
	upgrading abattoirs to meet stringent EC rules.
	    Should the EC ban Zimbabwean exports, the country will be
	forced to sell its beef on glutted world beef markets at low
	prices, the source said. Projected earnings from beef sales
	could fall about 23 mln dlrs as a result, he said.

	ZIMBABWE WAGE FREEZE SHOWS ECONOMIC MALAISE
TOPICS:
	
PLACES:
	zimbabwe
CONTENT:
	Zimbabwe's temporary freeze on salaries,
	wages and prices will give the economy a breather, but radical
	economic reforms are needed to resuscitate business and attract
	foreign investment, economists said.
	    They said the June 24 freeze on government, state company
	and private sector wages until January 1988 has postponed,
	rather than provided, solutions to Zimbabwe's economic
	problems.
	    They urged a review of the tax system, the introduction of
	investment incentives, a review of foreign exchange and price
	controls and a check on government expenditure.
	    These measures would aim to stimulate investment and create
	employment for the 100,000 school leavers annually seeking
	jobs.
	    The freeze, which Finance Minister Bernard Chidzero said
	would check production costs and reduce the budget deficit, has
	been partly welcomed by business but criticised by workers
	whose real purchasing power has been severely eroded since
	1980.
	    The government announced the freeze amid a worsening
	economic crisis caused by serious drought, a budget deficit of
	more than one billion Zimbabwean dlrs and an acute balance of
	payments problem owing to debt service costs, now 357 mln U.S.
	Dlrs on an external debt of two billion U.S. Dlrs.
	    The crisis has forced the country to make companies halve
	dividend remittances to overseas shareholders.
	    The Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce supported the
	freeze on wages and salaries but criticised the promised
	stricter control of prices of goods and services.
	    "If those companies whose costs of production increase are
	not allowed a price increase, profit margins will again be
	severely squeezed, and this would negate current government
	efforts to revitalise the economy," the chamber said.
	    The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions said the freeze would
	worsen the plight of the lowest paid workers.
	    The union body has been campaigning for a minimum monthly
	wage of 277 Zimbabwean dlrs (165 U.S. Dlrs). The lowest paid
	now earn about 100 dollars (60 U.S. Dlrs).
	    "Inflation is hitting hardest those in the low income
	bracket which demands that any economic recovery programme
	should be biased in their favour," the union body said.
	    It added that the promised price freeze was "bolting the
	stable door when in fact the horse is gone" because prices of
	most basic commodities had already risen phenomenally.
	    Both unions and business hope that the freeze heralds a
	return to wage bargaining between workers and employers, rather
	than government-regulated pay awards.
	    Zimbabwe has, since 1980, set annual minimum wages for
	different sectors of the economy and awarded wage and salary
	increments on a sliding scale which gave higher increases to
	the lowest paid.

	TURNER AND NEWALL SEEKS 71.7 MLN STG IN RIGHTS
TOPICS:
	
PLACES:

CONTENT:
	Turner and Newall Plc said it planned to
	raise a net 71.7 mln stg with a one-for-six rights issue of
	36.15 mln shares.
	    The shares would be offered at 205p, compared with Turner's
	price which fell to 227p from last night's close at 241p.
	    The group said the funds would be used to cut borrowings,
	which had risen to 234 mln stg at end-February, largely as a
	result of the takeover of <AE Plc>.
	    The company also reported pretax profits rising to 44.7 mln
	stg from 39.6 mln previously.
	    It noted that the purchase of AE involved the payment of
	some 125 mln stg cash as well as taking on AE's own borrowings
	of some 85 mln stg. The net debt/equity ratio at the year end
	had risen to 59 pct from 23 pct the year before, it added. The
	rights issue would cut borrowings and also allow further
	development through investment and acquisition.
	    But it said that the purchase of AE -- which was won after
	a long and acrimonious battle last year -- greatly strengthened
	the group's position in the automotive components and
	engineering materials sectors.
	    In the 15 months to end-1986 AE produced pretax profits of
	27.4 mln stg compared with 25.6 mln in the 12 months
	previously.
	   As the offer for AE was not declared unconditional until
	December 5, it made a negligible contribution to Turner's 1986
	results.
	    Turner said the prospects were good and it looked forward
	to taking advantage of the opportunities available.
	   1986 operating profits were higher in all areas apart from
	Zimbabwe mines, which were hit by the strength of the local
	currency against the dollar.

CONTENT:
	A range of substantial policy
	initiatives need to be implemented to shift resources from
	consumption to production in the Zimbabwe economy, says the
	Zimbabwe Banking Corporation (ZBC) in its quarterly economic
	review.
	    The state owned banking group says although Zimbabwe's
	balance of payments improved significantly last year the
	underlying position deteriorated. Last year's improved trade
	surplus was partly the result of sales of stockpiled gold and
	continued import restraint.
	    It says debt service charges are projected to exceed 35 pct
	of exports in 1987 and warns against squeezing imports further.
	    ZBC says mining industry import quotas for the first six
	months of 1987 have been halved and those for manufacturing
	industry cut by a third.
	    It contrasts the performance of manufacturing industry in
	1967 to 1974, with that since independence in 1980. Industrial
	production almost doubled between 1967 and 1974, when foreign
	currency allocations almost trebled in real terms.
	    Since 1980, import allocations have been cut 45 pct and the
	Zimbabwe dollar has depreciated by more than 60 pct. As a
	result the bank says the external purchasing power of foreign
	currency allocations is currently only 20 pct of its 1980
	levels.
