	USSR SEEN LIKELY TO HONOR CORN COMMITMENT

PLACES:

CONTENT:
	The Soviet Union will likely honor
	its commitment with the United States to buy a minimum of four
	mln tonnes of corn this year, an Agriculture Department
	official said.
	    "They have always honoured the agreement, and there's no
	reason now to think they won't this year," he told Reuters.
	    "They have an aggressive buying campaign from the European
	Community, from Canada, from the U.S. They're active buyers
	from all sources at this point," the official said in
	explaining why the Department raised its Soviet grain imports
	estimate today by three mln tonnes to 26 mln tonnes.
	    This is a dramatic shift from just a few months ago when
	analysts were saying the USSR might not buy any U.S. corn for
	the first time in 15 years.
	    A drawdown of corn supplies in China and Argentina, concern
	over Soviet winter crops, and increasing competition for U.S.
	corn were all cited as possible factors in creating Moscow's
	recent interest.
	    Lower corn production prospects in some major supplying
	countries have stirred activity from big buyers such as Japan,
	and the Soviets are also closely watching the situation, the
	official said.
	    "The Soviets will try to out-capitalize the capitalists"
	and buy corn before prices get too high, the official said. "As
	soon as they need corn, they'll buy it," he added.
	    USDA has confirmed one mln tonnes of corn sold to the
	Soviet Union, but both U.S. and Soviet analysts have said the
	purchases stand at 1.5 mln tonnes.
	    The USDA official would not speculate on when the Soviets
	would enter the U.S. market again.
	    "There has definitely been an evolving mind set -- from the
	situation of slow grain buying a couple months ago to one of
	frenetic buying now," the official said.
	    However, the situation in wheat is "a different story," he
	said. Greater world supplies of wheat, heavier Soviet purchase
	commitments and less competitive U.S. wheat prices make Soviet
	purchases of U.S. wheat less likely, he said.
	    Speculation has continued for several days that the U.S.
	is considering making an export bonus wheat subsidy offer to
	the Soviets, but U.S. officials have provided no confirmation.

	NUMEROUS FACTORS SAID POINT TO USSR CORN BUYING
TOPICS:
	grain, corn
PLACES:

CONTENT:
	A greater than anticipated need,
	competitive prices and political motivations could be sparking
	Soviet interest in U.S. corn, industry and government officials
	said.
	    As rumors circulated through grain markets today that the
	Soviet Union has purchased an additional 1.5 mln tonnes of U.S.
	corn, industry and government sources noted a number of factors
	that make Soviet buying of U.S. corn likely.
	    First, there are supply concerns. Some trade sources said
	recent speculation has been that last year's Soviet grain crop
	be revised to only 190 mln tonnes, rather than the 210 mln
	announced, therby increasing the Soviet need for grain.
	    A drop in Argentine corn crop prospects could also affect
	Soviet corn buying, an Agriculture Department source said.
	    Dry weather in Argentina -- a major corn supplier to the
	USSR -- and reported crop problems prompted USDA to lower its
	Argentine 1986/87 corn crop estimate this week to 11.0 mln
	tonnes, down from 11.5 mln. Argentina corn exports were also
	cut by 500,000 tonnes to 6.8 mln tonnes.
	    Argentina has already committed four mln tonnes of this
	year's corn for export, a USDA official said, with two mln
	tonnes of that booked for April-June delivery to the USSR.
	    "Significant downside potential" still exists for the
	Argentine crop, the official said, which will decrease the
	amount of additional corn that country can sell to Moscow.
	    "If the Soviet needs are greater than we have been
	thinking, then they might need more than what Argentina can
	provide during the April to June period," he said.
	    Current competitive prices for U.S. corn have also sparked
	Soviet buying.
	    U.S. corn was reported to be selling on the world market
	earlier this week for around 71 dlrs per tonne, Argentine corn
	for 67 dlrs -- a very competitive price spread, U.S. and Soviet
	sources said.
	    "This price difference makes American corn competitive,"
	Albert Melnikov, commercial counselor for the Soviet Union,
	told Reuters.
	    Impending crop problems in Argentina will likely cause
	those prices to rise, and with the recently strong U.S. corn
	futures prices, the Soviets might feel corn prices have
	bottomed and that this is a good time to buy, sources said.
	    Finally, some industry sources said that by buying the
	minimum amount of corn guaranteed under the U.S./USSR grains
	agreement (four mln tonnes), the Soviet Union may be hoping to
	convince the USDA to offer Moscow a subsidy on wheat.
	    In an inteview with Reuters this week, USDA secretary
	Richard Lyng said that no decision had been made on a wheat
	subsidy offer, but that such an offer had not been ruled out.

	U.S. GRAIN TRADE CALLS SHULTZ REMARK SIGNIFICANT
TOPICS:
	grain, wheat
PLACES:
	usa, ussr
CONTENT:
	A statement yesterday by Secretary
	of State George Shultz after he met with wheat growers that
	U.S. agricultural products must be competitively priced was
	significant in that he recognized the importance of the Soviet
	market and the need for U.S. prices to be at world market
	levels, U.S. grain trade industry officials said.
	    They said that Shultz's comments, while not explicitly
	endorsing subsidized wheat sales to the USSR, were noteworthy
	because they were not negative towards such action.
	    In response to a query on what the State Department's
	position is on selling subsidized wheat to Moscow, Shultz told
	the leaders of the National Association of Wheat Growers that
	prices must be competitive if the U.S. is going to trade.
	    The Soviet Union, the world's largest grain importer, has
	bought no U.S. wheat for more than a year, complaining the
	price was far above world market levels. A U.S. offer last fall
	to sell the Soviets lower-priced wheat through the export
	enhancement program, EEP, was also rebuffed due to the price.
	    Shultz was said to be adamantly against the U.S. wheat
	offer last year and has been reported to be one of the major
	obstacles in making another subsidy overture to the Soviet
	Union, grain industry sources said.
	    Intense speculation the U.S. might make a fresh EEP wheat
	offer to the Soviets has boosted grain prices significantly in
	recent trading sessions. Kansas City hard wheat futures rose
	another 2-1/4 cents by midday at 2.88-1/4 dlrs per bushel,
	while CBT March wheat was up 1-1/2 cents at 2.92-1/2 dlrs.
	    "I'm not sure this is an about-face, but it's clearly a
	recognition that unless we're competitive, we won't sell to the
	Soviet Union," said a lobbyst for a major commodity group.
	    "We have to be competitive. It's ridiculous to say that
	somebody is going to buy your product if they can get the same
	thing at a lower price somewhere else," Shultz told the farm
	leaders. "That is our approach in negotiations with the
	Soviets," he said.
	    If those comments do signal that the State Department is no
	longer opposed to the U.S. selling wheat to the USSR under EEP,
	it certainly improves the chances for an EEP wheat offer to
	Moscow, an industry lobbyst said.
	    National Wheat Grower's officials were taking a cautious
	attitude towards the secretary's comments.
	    "His comments were not discouraging, but they didn't in our
	judgment promise any immediate action on EEP," an official with
	the wheat group said.
	    The Wheat Growers official noted, however, that "there is
	significance in that fact that we haven't seen any significant
	negative commentary on the idea of EEP wheat to the Soviets."
	    In a meeting with exporters this week, Secretary of
	Agriculture Richard Lyng refused to comment on their request
	that the administration offer subsidized wheat to Moscow, the
	officials said.
	    An aide to USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz, who is
	reported to be strongly opposed to EEP wheat to the Soviets,
	said that the Shultz comments "are consistent with what he
	(Shultz) has taught for years as an economist," but said they
	don't necessarily relate to the Soviet Union.
	    Amstutz could not be reached for comment, and an aide to
	Lyng said Lyng would not comment on Shultz's statements.
	    But trade sources were hopeful that the Shultz comments may
	indicate some movement towards EEP wheat to Moscow.
	    "If he didn't say no, then there's a chance. This is
	potentially a positive development," a commodity source said.

	Soviet livestock herds are possibly

	    Livestock procurement levels for January and February were

	five pct from year ago levels, an attache report said.
	    "These procurement levels ... are surprisingly normal given
	the harshness of the 1986/87 winter ... indicating neither

	output. While the overwintering period is not over yet, the
	worst of it is, and herds are possibly in better shape than
	expected," the counselor said.
	    A healthy livestock sector will keep Soviet feed demand 
	strong and impact USSR grain imports, analysts said.
	    January livestock procurement levels were up only 1.6 pct,
	indicating a turn around in February, an Agriculture Department
	analyst of the Soviet Union said.
	    The analyst said an easing of the cold weather in February,
	coupled with heavy amounts of grain fed to the animals would
	account for the rise in procurements.
	    "There's no question that the (Soviet) livestock is in good
	shape," he said.

	Prospects for renewal of the

	NO PRESSING NEED FOR SOVIET WHEAT SUBSIDY - LYNG
TOPICS:

CONTENT:
	The Soviets have not indicated an
	urgent need for a U.S. wheat subsidy offer, and it is unlikely
	that such an offer will be ma during the U.S./Soviet summit
	expected to be held next month, Agriculture Secretary Richard
	Lyng told Reuters.
	    In an exclusive interview with Reuters, Lyng said he did
	not know if the United States will offer Moscow another wheat
	subsidy offer this year or when that offer will be made.
	    "Last year it was well into the year before we offered it.
	There's been nothing that's taken place to indicate to me that
	there's a pressing need on their part for that sort of deal (a
	wheat subsidy)."
	    When asked if a subsidy would be offered at a U.S./Soviet
	summit, Lyng said, "No, I don't think so. I don't think that."
	    The Agriculture Secretary said a U.S. wheat subsidy deal to
	Moscow would not be the kind of topic appropriate for
	discussion at a summit.
	    "It would not be the kind of issue that the President or the
	Chairman would get into specific negotiations or discussions
	about," Lyng said.
	    "When Mr. Nikonov (communist party secretary for
	agriculture) was here ... he indicated that trade in wheat was
	not something that would be discussed with the President of the
	United States. He said it's not presidential," Lyng said.
	    Lyng said uncertainties about wheat quality in some major
	producing areas of the world, volatile wheat prices and the
	still unfinished Soviet grain harvest could delay any final
	decision on the timing of another wheat subsidy to Moscow.
	    The future of the U.S./Soviet long-term grains agreement
	will be discussed the first of next year, Lyng said, but the
	Agriculture Secretary questioned the benefits of the
	long-standing agreement.
	    "We've had three years in a row in which the Soviets have
	failed to live up to their end of the agreement ... We would
	love to continue to keep doing busines with the Soviet Union,
	but do we need a long-term agreement. Who benefits from that.
	These are some of the questions we need to discuss."
	    When asked if he felt the United States has benefitted from
	the agreement, Lyng said, "I don't know. It certainly hasn't
	been what we had hoped it would be. For three years running
	they've (Moscow) failed to live up to what we considered was an
	agreement."
