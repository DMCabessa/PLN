CONTENT:
	Following is the text of a statement
	by the Group of Seven -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France,
	Britain, Italy and Canada -- issued after a Washington meeting
	yesterday.
	    1. The finance ministers and central bank governors of
	seven major industrial countries met today.
	    They continued the process of multilateral surveillance of
	their economies pursuant to the arrangements for strengthened
	economic policy coordination agreed at the 1986 Tokyo summit of
	their heads of state or government.
	    The managing director of the International Monetary Fund
	also participated in the meeting.
	    2. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the commitment to
	the cooperative approach agreed at the recent Paris meeting,
	and noted the progress achieved in implementing the
	undertakings embodied in the Louvre Agreement.
	    They agreed, however, that further actions will be
	essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain
	global economic expansion, and reduce trade imbalances.
	    In this connection they welcomed the proposals just
	announced by the governing Liberal Democratic Party in Japan
	for extraordinary and urgent measures to stimulate Japan's
	economy through early implementation of a large supplementary
	budget exceeding those of previous years, as well as
	unprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures.
	    The government of Japan reaffirmed its intention to further
	open up its domestic markets to foreign goods and services.
	    3. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the view that
	around current levels their currencies are within ranges
	broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic
	policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.
	    In that connection they welcomed the strong implementation
	of the Louvre Agreement.
	    They concluded that present and prospective progress in
	implementing the policy undertakings at the Louvre and in this
	statement provided a basis for continuing close cooperation to
	foster the stability of exchange rates.

	Deputy Finance Ministers from the Group
	of 10 leading western industrialised countries met here to
	discuss the world debt crisis, trade imbalances and currency
	stability today following last month's Paris monetary accord,
	sources close to the talks said.
	    The officials met at the offices of the International
	Monetary Fund (IMF) to discuss broad aspects of world monetary
	policy in preparation for the IMF's interim committee meeting
	in Washington in April.
	    The talks were the first high-level international review of
	the monetary situation since the accord last month reached by
	the U.S., West Germany, France, Britain, Japan and Canada to
	stabilise world currency markets at around present levels
	following the 40 pct slide in the dollar since mid-1985.
	    Other countries represented at today's talks were Italy,
	which refused to attend last month's meeting on the grounds
	that it was being excluded from the real discussions, the
	Netherlands, Belgium and Switzerland.
	    Many of the officials had met earlier today and yesterday
	within the framework of the Organisation for Economic
	Cooperation and Development (OECD) to review the slow progress
	being made in cutting the record 170 billion dlr U.S. Trade
	deficit and persuading West Germany and Japan to open their

	U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker met West
	German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and Bundesbank
	President Karl Otto Poehl in Frankfurt on Monday, a Bonn
	Finance Ministry spokesman said.
	    After the meeting the spokesman quoted Stoltenberg as
	saying he was confident that foreign currencies could be
	stabilised at around current levels.
	    The meeting came after Baker criticised West Germany for
	increasing short-term money market interest rates. He had said
	the rise was not in line with the spirit of the Louvre accord
	aimed at stabilizing the U.S. dollar last February.
	    The meeting had been arranged last week, the spokesman
	said. Baker, Stoltenberg and Poehl had agreed to pursue the
	policies agreed under the Louvre pact with reference to
	currency stability and monetary policy.
	    Earlier on Monday the Bundesbnak injected liquidity into
	the West German money market in a move which money market
	dealers interpreted as an attempt by the West German monetary
	authority to curb interest rate rises.
	    The spokesman described Monday's talks, which he called

CONTENT:
	Treasury Secretary James Baker said
	the United States and other nations were willing to cooperate
	to stabilize foreign exchange rates at the levels that existed
	at the time of an international agreement last month.
	    "Our position with respect to the dollar goes back to the
	Paris Agreement that the currencies were within ranges broadly
	consistent with underlying economic conditions," Baker told a
	Senate committee.
	    Baker continued, "We said further that we and others are
	willing to cooperate closely to foster stability in exchange
	rates around those levels."
	    He referred to a February agreement by six leading
	industrial nations to cooperate on monetary matters.
	    Baker refused to answer a question whether Japan and
	Germany had done enough to stimulate their domestic economies
	for the United States to support the dollar.
	    "I will not comment because the foreign exchange market
	reads more or less than is intended in my statements," Baker
	said.
	    Baker said that the other signatories recognized that they
	must carry their share of the load of correcting external
	imbalances that have hindered the world's economy.
	    He cited news reports that Germany would increase a
	proposed tax cut for 1988 by about five billion marks to
	stimulate domestic growth.
	    Japan also agreed to consider stimulative measures after
	the Japanese budget was made final.
	    Baker said those nations were stimulating their economies
	in a manner consistent with gains against inflation.

	JAPAN HAS NO PLANS TO CUT DISCOUNT RATE
TOPICS:

CONTENT:
	Bank of Japan sources said the bank
	has no plans to cut its discount rate.
	    They told reporters that there was no pressure on Japan
	during the Group of Seven (G-7) meeting here yesterday to lower
	its discount rate. They added that they themselves do not feel
	any need for a cut at all.
	    Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told reporters
	earlier today that some countries - those with strong
	currencies - might have to cut interest rates.
	    The Bank of Japan sources also said that it was too soon to
	call the G-7 pact a failure.
	    The central bank sources were commenting on the dollar's
	renewed tumble in New York and Tokyo, which was sparked by
	remarks by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that the
	dollar's fall had been orderly.
	    They said the market must have misinterpreted Baker's
	comments because he was referring to the dollar's fall since
	the Plaza agreement in September 1985, over a long-time span,
	not the currency's recent movements.
	    They added that the foreign exchange markest seem to seize
	on anything to use as an excuse to drive the dollar one way or
	the other.
	    The Bank of Japan sources said the U.S. Is putting more
	weight on the dollar/yen rate in terms of judging market
	stability than on other currencies.
	    Throughout the G-7 meeting, Japan pointed to the dangers
	that would arise from a further dollar fall because it would
	reduce the flow of Japanese capital to the U.S., Hurting the
	U.S. And world economies, they said.
	    In February and in March of this year, Japanese investors
	reduced their purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds, the sources
	said.
	    Each country in the G-7 - Britain, Canada, France, Italy,
	Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - has a different view about
	currency stability, the Bank of Japan sources said.
	    This is because the overall foreign exchange market is a
	triangle of dollar/yen, European currencies/yen and
	dollar/European currencies.
	    At the time of the Louvre agreement, European countries did
	not want the yen to weaken against their currencies so they did
	not object to the yen strengthening, they said.

	ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN EYEING FOREIGN STOCKS
TOPICS:
	
PLACES:
	japan, usa, uk, france, hong-kong
CONTENT:
	Japanese life insurers, trust banks and
	corporations, largely responsible for vitalising the U.S. Bond
	market in recent years, are now eyeing stockmarkets in the
	U.S., Britain, France and Hong Kong, fund managers said.
	    After concentrating on U.S. Treasury bonds for years,
	Japanese institutions now see a risk in relying too much on
	similar types of investments, they said.
	    Japan's net buying in overseas stockmarkets this year may
	double or triple to 15-20 billion dlrs from seven billion in
	1986, Shigeki Matsumoto of Nikko Securities Co Ltd, said.
	    Matsumoto, who manages Nikko's investment research and
	strategy, said there is evidence Japanese investors began
	poking around in foreign stockmarkets around July last year,
	but few made firm commitments until December when net purchases
	suddenly grew to 1.5 billion dlrs from around 500 mln in each
	of the previous five months.
	    Net buying in 1985 totalled only 995 mln dlrs, he added.
	    This sudden penchent for overseas stocks is likely to draw
	the widest smiles from Wall Street because about 70 to 80 pct
	of funds will be invested in the U.S. Markets, Matsumoto said.
	    "The trend has been to head toward the U.S. Market, first
	because of its size and next because it has been successful
	over the last couple of years," said Eugene Atkinson, managing
	director of Goldman Sachs International Corp.
	    Wall Street's massive turnover offers good liquidity,
	enabling institutions to easily move large volumes of money in
	and out of shares with the minimum of risk, he added.
	    However, few see holdings in U.S. Treasuries dwindling.
	They will remain a Japanese mainstay, fund managers said.
	    Institutions, particularly life insurance companies which
	concentrate on income rather than capital gains to cover
	payouts to policy holders, are unlikely to sell their U.S.
	Treasuries, but will put in less money, said Shinichi Kobuse,
	manager of Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's international fixed
	income activities.
	    There has been some selling of U.S. Bonds by short-term
	investors, but the selling is unlikely to amount to a
	significant chunk of Japanese bond holdings because the
	liquidity of the U.S. Bond market remains attractive, he added.
	    Kobuse said investment managers are bullish on the U.S.
	Equity markets despite predictions by economists the U.S.
	Economy will remain sluggish over the next couple of months.
	    Interest in Wall Street has been spurred by recent reports
	of significant growth in earnings by major U.S. Corporations,
	he added.
	    Yutaka Hashimoto general manager of Nippon Life Insurance
	Co told an economic conference that insurance companies, which
	are responsible for 26 pct of Japanese funds in foreign
	securities, hold a lopsided proportion of U.S. Treasuries and
	intend to diversify into other instruments and currencies.
	    Insurance companies have put the dominant portion of their
	funds into the U.S., But will now invest in Britain, West
	Germany, France and other countries, Hashimoto said.
	    Lower interest rates worldwide make the returns on stocks
	relatively high in comparison with bonds and in light of the
	strength in the yen, the growth in stock values is expected to
	offset currency risks, he added.
	    One trust bank official said his bank aims for a 10 pct
	annual return on overseas investments but the recent decline in
	U.S. 30-year bond yields has caused a rethink in pension fund
	investment stategies.
	    The bank is looking more at U.S. Equities and European
	bonds, he said.
	    Japanese investments in British equities have already
	turned active and the pace is likely to increase, said Andrew
	Sheaf, general manager of international equity activities at
	County Securities Japan.
	    "Last week was the busiest week we had," he said.
	    Investments are being spurred by the growth in profits of
	British companies and the recent deregulation of government
	controlled firms, fund managers said.
	    Deregulation in France is also attracting Japanese
	interest, but stock investments there will be inhibited by
	worries about the French franc, they said.
	    Investments in Hong Kong will be mostly short-term and
	speculative due to uncertainty about the colony's long-term
	political stability, they added.
	    Japanese investors are cautious about West Germany,
	particularly as German firms, like their Japanese counterparts,
	are concerned about the recent dollar fall.
	    Australia also poses some risks due to currency values,
	they added.

	U.S. APPEARS TO TOLERATE FURTHER DLR DECLINE
TOPICS:

PLACES:

CONTENT:
	In a bid to hasten Japan's promise
	to speed up its economic growth and open markets to foreign
	trade, top U.S. officials appear once again to have signaled
	their tolerance of a lower dollar.
	    Treasury Secretary James Baker and one of his top aides,
	Assistant Secretary David Mulford, said last week there was no
	target for the dollar, a statement that sent the yen soaring
	against the dollar, despite massive central bank intervention.
	    "That was no slip of the tongue," said one western monetary
	official, who asked not to be identified.
	    For now, the strategy appears to be working. Japanese
	officials said late last week a package to bolster domestic
	demand will be ready in early April. Until last week, there
	were few indications the package would be ready anytime soon.
	    The Reagan administration, facing an uproar in Congress
	over the apparent lack of progress in cutting the 169.8 billion
	dlr trade deficit, is learning now that to extract results from
	Japan, dramatic action is required.
	    Last week the White House imposed unprecedented tariffs on
	certain Japanese electronic goods after Tokyo failed to adhere
	to a semi-conductor pricing accord between the two countries.
	    The shift in U.S. strategy, in part designed to appease
	mounting Congressional anger over Japanese policies, comes just
	two weeks before industrial nations reconvene here to review
	the Paris agreement to stabilize currencies.
	    And news that Japan earned a record 18 billion dlr trade
	surplus in the first two months this year just underscored the
	need for urgent action, in the view of U.S. officials.
	    Nonetheless, U.S. officials see signs of improvement in the
	deficit. "I'd be stunned if we were not going to derive some
	benefits (from the lower dollar) soon," said one.
	    In Paris, leading industrial nations agreed to cooperate
	closely to foster currency stability within ranges reflecting
	"underlying economic fundamentals" or economic reality.
	    The agreement envisages those fundamentals to include Japan
	and West Germany stimulating their economies and the United
	States cutting its budget deficit.
	    The three nations, joined by France, Britain and Canada,
	agree these policies are essential to redress huge global trade
	imbalances.
	    But analysts say markets have signalled the underlying
	fundamentals imply a lower dollar, rather than a stable one.
	    Markets, in effect, are less confident than governments
	that these measures -- including U.S. budget deficit cuts
	agreed by Congress and the White House --will be carried out.
	    Nonetheless, the dollar's sharp fall has not undermined 
	cooperation. A U.S. economic policymaker said the accord was on
	track and Tokyo and Bonn seem "to want more stimulative measures
	which is what the Paris accord calls for."
	    International monetary sources said exchange market
	developments generally have not unsettled policymakers,
	although Japan is an obvious exception. "Everybody feels it can
	still be managed," one source said of market developments.
	    But last week, the Bank of Japan spent an estimated five
	billion dlrs intervening to halt the rise in the yen, and other
	central banks about one billion dlrs.
	    Another monetary source said Japan was upset with America's
	half-hearted attempt to halt the falling dollar, flouting the
	Paris accord outright.
	    The source, close to the top levels of Japanese economic
	policymaking, said Japan's understanding of the accord was that
	the yen would be kept at around 154 to the dollar, the level it
	stood at when the accord was struck.
	    The source said Tokyo was extremely worried by Washington's
	use of the exchange rate to change Japanese policies. It was a
	"pointed reminder" to Japan to do something about the trade
	issues, the source said of the dollar's fall against the yen.
	    By departing last Sunday from the language of the Paris
	accord -- that nations agreed to foster currency stability
	around current levels -- Baker triggered a run on the dollar.
	    Later in the week, Mulford too said there was no target for
	the dollar and called on Japan and West Germany to live up to
	their international responsibilities and stimulate growth.
	    But U.S. officials said recent market developments will not
	unravel the spirit of the Paris agreement.
	    "There's a realisation now that you cannot leave things
	alone, everyone agrees that the external (trade) imbalances
	ought to be adjusted," one official said.
	    "While no-one is going to cede national sovereignty, we
	certainly seem to be moving towards much closer co-operation,"
	another U.S. official said.
	    The officials said the meeting here, where the six will be
	joined by Italy, will be a status report.
	    "Japan will have to explain what the state of their program
	is and Germany will report on its plans. Maybe there's a need
	to move faster," one source said.
	    Mulford told Congress last week the Paris accord called, in
	effect, for currency stability for several months. This would
	buy time for Japan and West Germany to speed up their economic
	growth and help bring down the U.S. trade deficit.
	    His comments appeared to serve notice on other major
	nations that Washington cannot wait too long for action to
	reduce the gap between the Japanese and German trade surpluses
	and the U.S. trade deficit.

	fundamentals.
	    Sumita told reporters major nations have cooperated to
	bring about currency stability in line with the Paris

	U.S/Japan relations on certain key trade issues very strained.
	    The market reacted nervously because the dollar has been

	Treasury Assistant Secretary David
	Mulford reaffirmed U.S. backing for the Paris Agreement among
	six industrial nations to cooperate closely to foster exchange
	rate stability around current levels.
	    In testimony prepared for delivery before a Senate banking
	subcommittee, Mulford said there was broad recognition in Paris
	that "further substantial exchange rate shifts could damage
	growth and adjustment prospects."
	    But he also said while there are clear understandings among
	the countries regarding cooperation, "We have refrained from
	establishing a system of target zones or ranges."
	    Mulford also said the six nations have not spelled out the
	way in which they intend to deal with possible market
	developments.
	    He said governments must retain flexibility in dealing with
	exchange market pressures and efforts to establish rigid
	exchange rate objectives "or to specify too precisely the goals
	of intervention" would hurt official attempts to react to
	market pressures, he said.
	    Accordingly, Mulford said setting specific currency
	objectives and intervention to achieve those objectives would
	be counterproductive.
	    Commenting on the trade deficit, Mulford reiterated the
	Treasury position that the current account deficit will decline
	from 148 billion dlrs last year to around 130 billion dlrs this
	year, due to the exchange rate adjustments of the past 18
	months.
	    But he added trade imbalances would also be corrected by
	commitments from West Germany and Japan to stimulate their
	economies and by U.S. efforts to cut the budget deficit and
	enhance U.S. competitiveness.
	    He also said some newly industrialized countries should let

	    But the yen should go up 10 or 15 pct in value, Ortner
	said, because it is undervalued against the dollar.
	    The United States and major trade allies West Germany,
	France, Britain, Japan and Canada met recently in Paris to
	discuss maintaining stability in international currency values.

	EUROPEAN MARKETS REACT QUIETLY TO G-7 COMMUNIQUE
TOPICS:

CONTENT:
	European currency markets reacted quietly
	to the G-7 communique, with comments from bankers and dealers
	ranging from disappointment that it was not more concrete to
	surprise that the markets should have expected so much.
	    The dollar opened lower against virtually all currencies
	and traded in a narrow range after the communique, which
	reaffirmed support for the Paris accord on currency
	stabilisation but contained no moves to strengthen it.
	    Dealers in Frankfurt and Zurich saw the dollar remaining
	broadly entrenched in its current trading range.
	    "The dollar is likely to stay within a range of 1.80 to 1.84
	marks," said Gisela Steinhaeuser, senior dealer at Chase Bank
	AG. She said there was some resistance to further climbs.
	    However, she said the dollar could break out of the range
	with major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S.
	Merchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday.
	    Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltd
	in Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady against
	the mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen,
	possibly to 140 yen.
	    A Milan banker shared Stadelmann's view, saying he expects
	a dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term.
	    London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curb
	underlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negative
	sentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbank
	operators to test the downside.
	    Concern that finance ministers and officials still in
	Washington could issue more concrete statements in favour of
	currency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along with
	worries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in the
	near term, the traders said.
	    Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at the
	communique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar's
	downward trend.
	    Traders in several centres said the market would look for
	fresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks to
	defend current ranges, which the communique said were "broadly
	consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy
	intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting."
	    Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said
	"They're going to put somebody's resolve to the test soon." The
	U.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said.
	    However, some dealers said London-based operators would be
	unlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the long
	Easter weekend. They saw near-term technical support at 1.825
	marks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen.
	    Chase Bank's Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers said
	the G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stable
	market for the foreseeable future compared with the extreme
	volatility seen in the first few months of this year.
	    One dealer at a German bank said the wording of the
	communique made clear the leading nations did not want a
	further dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar.
	    The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to
	1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvre
	accord's supposed currency target range.
	    A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets were
	ready for a period of "mainly sideways movement."
	    But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communique
	contributing to greater stability.
	    "Nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a big
	boost," said one dealer, while another Italian banker said he
	expects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 German marks
	in the next three months.
	    A Swiss monetary source, who asked not to be named, said
	the communique had been in line with realistic expectations and
	should not have produced disappointment.
	    "The problem is that the changes needed in fiscal and trade
	policies to redress current imbalances are of a different
	timescale than currency markets operate on," the source told
	Reuters, "This is a political process which takes time."
	    Alois Schwietert, chief economist at Swiss Bank Corp in
	Basle, also questioned the tone of disappointment evident on
	currency markets today. "Did people really expect a patent
	remedy?" he asked.
	    Bank economists in Paris noted yesterday's meeting was only
	the first in a series and said the market would watch carefully
	in the next few weeks for any changes in positions.
	    A senior economist with Banque Indosuez said the focus was
	now on trade and growth rather than interest rates. Any move by
	Japan and West Germany to boost their economic growth could
	lead to a quick change in the U.S. Position.
	    Dealers in all centres agreed that markets would be wary in
	pushing the dollar too far too quickly in the coming months
	while central banks appear resolved to use their muscle to
	support the Paris accord.

	LAWSON SAYS SOME COUNTRIES COULD CUT RATES
TOPICS:
	interest
PLACES:
	usa, uk
CONTENT:
	Nigel Lawson, Britain's Chancellor of
	the Exchequer, said some countries may need to cut interest
	rates with the aim of maintaining exchange rate stability.
	    Speaking to journalists one day after the Group of Seven
	countries reaffirmed goals set in Paris six weeks ago, he said
	central banks would continue to intervene "as and when
	necessary."
	    He said the G-7 countries were concerned that Japan do more
	to stimulate domestic demand and welcomed measures outlined by
	Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa yesterday.
	    Lawson said he was still worried about  the risk of a
	simultaneous recession in the United States, Japan and West
	Germany, though less so than when he gave his March 17 budget
	speech to the British Parliament.
	    "If anything I'm a little bit less concerned, but there is
	still a risk," he said.
	    Asked if the United States should consider increasing
	interest rates to support the dollar, he said, "If there is a
	need for changes in relative interest rates, it doesn't need to
	be a rise in interest rates in the United States."
	    Lawson said there was some concern expressed in yesterday's
	meetings at the slow progress the United States had made in
	reducing its budget deficit.
	    "We believe there will be some worthwhile progress in
	reducing the deficit this year. The important thing is that it
	continue year after year," Lawson said.
	    The February 22 Louvre accord called for efforts to
	stabilize currencies at then-current exchange rates. In the six
	weeks that followed the Japanese yen continued to rise against
	the dollar despite massive central bank intervention.
	    Asked whether this intervention was a sign of weakness in
	the Louvre accord, he said, "I don't think so. If there had been
	no intervention you would have called that a sign of weakness."
	    Although intervention could be a cause of inflation, Lawson
	said, "the world does not appear to be in an inflationary mode
	... but one has to be vigilant."
	    He said yesterday's G-7 statement, which affirmed that
	"current levels" of exchange rates were appropriate, had been
	"carefully worded." "We know what we mean, and we all mean the
	same thing," he said.
	    Lawson said financial markets seem to believe that Japanese
	measures outlined in the Louvre accord were the source of
	weakness for that agreement.
	    Therefore, the G-7 countries welcomed Miyazawa's
	presentation of plans for a supplemental budget to stimulate
	domestic demand.
	    They particularly welcomed the goal of an immediate
	increase in public works spending, but Lawson said the package
	also involved a second stage to increase expenditures during
	the second half of this year.
