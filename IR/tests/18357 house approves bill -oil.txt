	FED APPROVES CHASE MANHATTAN COMMERCIAL DEALING
TOPICS:

CONTENT:
	The Federal Reserve Board has
	approved the application of Chase Manhattan Corp to engage in
	underwriting and dealing in commercial paper of Chase
	Commercial Corp, the lending subsidiary of the parent bank
	holding company.
	    The Fed order said Chase Manhattan's application was
	consistent with sound banking practices and existing laws. But
	it added a bill adopted by the Senate Banking Committee last
	week could affect Chase Manhattan if it becomes law and might
	force it eventually to cease commercial paper underwriting
	activities.
	     The Fed said the application was similar to that of
	Bankers Trust to engage in commercial paper placement that was
	approved last December.
	    Chase Manhattan Corp, with consolidated assets of 90
	billion dlrs, is the second largest banking organization in New
	York and operates in the United States and abroad.
	    The Fed noted the Securities Industry Association, a trade
	association of the investment banking industry, had opposed
	Chase Manhattan's application for more powers.
	    Chase Manhattan now will be able to underwrite commercial
	paper, buying it for resale to institutions like banks.
	     In addition, Chase Manhattan will be able to place
	commercial paper as agents for issuers and advise them on rates
	and maturities of proposed issues just as Bankers Trust was
	given authority to do.
	    The minimum denomination of commercial paper offered and
	purchased would be 250,000 dlrs.
	    The Fed said it felt there would be no violation of banking
	laws provided that Chase Manhattan restricted its commercial
	paper activities to five pct of its income and five pct of
	total market share.
	    The Fed said dealing in commercial paper was related to
	Chase Manhattan's regular banking activities because "this kind
	of instrument has many of the characteristics of a traditional
	commercial loan."
	    "Because of its short term nature, commercial paper is
	customarily held to maturity -- like a commercial loan," the Fed
	order said.
	    Among the benefits for the public will be increased
	competition in the commercial paper market and more convenient
	service for borrowers and investors, the Fed said.

	The Thai Cabinet approved a seven pct
	increase in the national budget for fiscal 1987/88 starting
	next October, compared with a 6.2 pct increase for the current
	year ending September, a government spokesman said.
	    He told reporters the budget, to be presented to Parliament
	by late next month or in early June, calls for spending of
	243.5 billion baht against 227.5 billion this year.
	    The new budget is intended to make Thailand's Gross
	Domestic Product grow by at least five pct during the year
	without compromising its conservative fiscal and monetary
	policy, the spokesman said.
	    "The budget is in line with our policy to stimulate the
	economy and to achieve a stable growth while we continue
	maintaining our current cautious fiscal policy," he said.
	    The spokesman said the budget provides for a 9.6 pct
	increase in fresh government investment expenditure to 39.8
	billion baht, up from 36.3 billion this year.
	    Government revenue is projected to grow 7.5 pct to 199.5
	billion baht against 185.5 billion targetted for 1986/87.
	    He said the budget contains a 44 billion baht deficit, or
	about 3.4 pct of GDP, compared with 42 billion or 3.5 pct
	planned for this year.  The deficit is required by Thai laws to
	be financed by domestic borrowings.
	    The finalised budget bill earmarks 59.8 billion baht, or
	24.6 pct of total expenditure, for servicing the government's
	domestic and foreign debt, up from 56 billion and a similar
	24.6 pct this year.

	U.S. COFFEE IMPORT REPORTING SYSTEM QUESTIONED
TOPICS:
	coffee
PLACES:
	usa
CONTENT:
	A voluntary compliance system for
	monitoring U.S. coffee imports under quotas is viewed
	skeptically by many in the coffee industry, said analysts and
	trade sources.
	    "Many sectors of the trade, including large roasters and 
	importers, are adamant against voluntary compliance because of
	the past, which was subject to tremendous irregularities as it
	became a matter of the trade monitoring each other," one
	analyst said.
	    On Monday, a National Coffee Association newsletter said
	the Office of U.S. Trade Representative will implement a
	voluntary compliance system temporarily because legislation to
	monitor imports is tied up in the Congressional trade bill.
	    Under the arrangement, milar to one in 1980, coffee
	importers would voluntarily present needed documents to the
	U.S. government until Congress approves the monitoring
	authority, but if coffee arrives without valid certification,
	it will still be allowed entry.
	    While many believe producers will not seek to add to the
	overburdened stock situation in the U.S., others believe some
	will ship outside of the quota requirements in lieu of
	monitoring controls, trade sources said.
	    "Last time, there was a lot of false information submitted
	to customs which resulted in a lot of indictments and fines," a
	U.S. Customs spokesman said.
	    "Customs can do a good job when given the tools, but when
	its hands are tied, it doesn't have the authority to demand
	Form O (documents tracking merchandise from source to
	destination)," he said.
	    Many see it as a true test of whether producers and
	importers will abide by the quota system.
	    "It is a key to seeing whether there are any teeth in the
	quota agreement," said one major U.S. roaster.
	     "Last time we had a gentleman's agreement, the trade did
	not act as a gentleman," said another analyst adding, "without
	the need to submit documents, the ball will be in the
	producers' hands."
	    Some feel that importers will take advantage of the
	voluntary compliance due to development of a two-tier market,
	in which non-member countries buy coffee at a big discount.
	Many fear that dealers will buy coffee destined for non-member
	countries at discounts and then bring it into the U.S. falsely
	labelled.
	    According to customs officials, several green coffee
	importers confessed in 1985 that they had imported coffee
	fraudulently after buying it for non-member destinations,
	forging landing certificates and then relabelling it as navy
	beans.
	    "If there's that much of a discrepancy between prices for
	one country and another, producers may be teted to get rid of
	their stocks of coffee by selling to non-member nations and by
	circumventing the quota provisions," said Paine Webber analyst
	Bernie Savaiko.
	    Still, others believe that producers will not be hard
	pressed to aggravate the overburdened coffee stock situation in
	the U.S. in the near term.
	    "It would be naive to suggest that any agreement would not
	have some share of connivance, but I think the voluntary system
	seemed to suffice and, coupled with the fact that we have so
	much coffee, I don't think that it poses that much of a
	threat," one trader said.

	U.S. HOUSE APPROVES PILOT 0/92 DISASTER PROGRAM
TOPICS:

PLACES:

CONTENT:
	The House of Representatives
	approved a bill to enable 1987 winter wheat and feedgrains
	farmers hit by midwestern flooding last year to receive at
	least 92 pct of their federal income support payments even if
	they did not plant.
	    The one-time pilot 0/92 program, designed to assist farmers
	in Kansas, Oklahoma, Michigan and parts of Missouri, was passed
	by a 304-100 vote and sent to the Senate.
	    Although the bill includes a narrow version of the 0/92
	provision endorsed by the Reagan administration, the U.S.
	Agriculture Department withheld its support from the measure.
	    USDA said the bill would discourage farmers from buying
	crop insurance and fall short of the administration's proposed
	broad-scale revision of farm programs.
	    The bill would permit winter wheat producers prevented from
	planting their 1987 crop last fall to receive 92 pct of the
	deficiency payments they would have received.
	    To be eligible, winter wheat farmers could not plant a
	different crop on that land this spring, although they could
	use the land for grazing or to plant hay.
	    USDA estimated this provision would save 30 mln dlrs,
	largely because of reduced crop forfeitures.
	    The bill also would aid about 200 feedgrains producers
	along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers who were prevented
	from planting crops this year because of residual damage from
	last fall's flooding.
	    In addition, the measure would require USDA to make full
	payment to farmers eligible for emergency assistance approved
	by Congress last fall.
	    Currently, because claims have outstripped the 400 mln dlrs
	in appropriated funds, USDA plans to offer farmers in the
	region 74 cents for every dollar in disaster losses.
	    The administration said it opposed the bill because, by
	expanding the 400 mln dlrs in disaster relief, it would thwart
	efforts to encourage farmers to buy crop insurance as an
	alternative to federal disaster assistance.
	    USDA also said the 0/92 provisions in the bill were
	narrower than the administration's proposal to offer the option
	to all major commodities and would produce insignificant
	savings.
	    USDA said the 0/92 option for 1987 winter wheat farmers
	would produce a net savings of about 30 mln dlrs, while the
	requirement to compensate fully disaster-struck farmers would
	cost about 135 mln dlrs, which must be appropriated by
	Congress. The feedgrains provision would cost about five mln
	dlrs.
	    USDA estimated the overall cost of the bill to be 111 mln
	dlrs.
	    In January the Senate approved a bill that would make 1987
	winter wheat farmers eligible for disaster assistance payments.
	    But the Senate bill would not offer the 0/92 option to
	wheat and feedgrains producers or raise the 400-mln dlr ceiling
	on the disaster assistance program.

	    Ongpin also said the International Finance Corp (IFC), a

	First Philippine Capital Fund.
	    The fund, to be launched jointly by New York investment

	during a trip to the United States in September.
	    There was still no word on when the fund, designed to

	    A telex from IFC to Ongpin said the IFC investment will

	    The capital fund and the Central Bank's debt conversion
