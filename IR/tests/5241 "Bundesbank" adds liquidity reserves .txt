	BUNDESBANK ADDS MONEY MARKET LIQUIDITY
TOPICS:

CONTENT:
	The Bundesbank came into the domestic
	money market to add temporary liquidity through federal
	government funds as call money rates rose above 4.0 pct,
	dealers said.
	    They estimated that the bulk of liquidity was added at
	about 3.95 pct. Call money fell to 3.90/4.0 pct after the move.
	It had been 3.80/90 on Friday.
	    The move came as call money extended a rise begun Friday
	after the Bundesbank took up some six billion marks owed to it
	by other European central banks after currency interventions in
	the framework of European Monetary System in January.
	    Rates could ease further in trading today but dealers
	expect them to rise later in the week as banks begin paying out
	funds for tax payments on behalf of clients.
	    Some 30 billion marks is likely to leave the market this
	month, with the bulk being paid out next week.
	    In anticipation of this liquidity drain, banks have stocked
	up reserves at the Bundesbank.
	    On Thursday, minimum reserve holdings declined to 57.0
	billion marks from 60.0 billion on Wednesday but were well
	above the 53.2 billion held on Tuesday. Daily average reserve
	holdings rose slightly to 54.7 billion marks from 54.5 billion.
	    The daily average reserve holdings were above the level of
	around 51 billion marks dealers said is needed for the required
	daily average for the month.
	    With the heavy tax drain in March, banks are likely to
	remain cautious about taking more liquidity out of reserves
	than is absolutely necessary.
	    However, a new securities repurchase pact likely to be
	added next week to replace a facility expiring then could
	somewhat offset the drain.
	    The Bundesbank is expected to allocate more than the 3.4
	billion marks which is due to be rolled over, dealers said.

	The Bundesbank accepted bids for 6.5
	billion marks at today's tender for a 28-day securities
	repurchase pact at a rate of 3.80 pct, a central bank spokesman
	said.
	    Banks, which bid for a total 8.6 billion marks liquidity,
	will be credited with the funds allocated tomorrow and must buy
	back securities pledged on April 22.
	    The allocation was in line with market expectations the
	Bundesbank would provide more than the 3.4 billion marks
	draining from this week as an earlier facility expires.
	    Call money fell to 3.60/70 pct ahead of the allocation from
	3.75/85 pct yesterday, dealers said.
	    The excess allocation compensates for public funds leaving
	the system which the Bundesbank added last week via
	government-owned banks.
	    However major tax payments by banks on behalf of customers
	drew to a close this week, lessening the need for liquidity.
	    The call money declines surprised some dealers, who
	speculated it was because the Bundesbank disbursed further
	government funds today. However, most said this had not
	occurred.
	    Banks were well stocked with liquidity, having 47.1 billion
	marks in minimum reserves at the Bundesbank on Friday, up from
	49.9 billion on Thursday. Average daily reserves over the first
	20 days of the month fell to 52.6 billion from 53.1 billion.
	For all of March, banks would be required to hold net daily
	average reserves of 50.7 billion marks, dealers said.

	    The Bundesbank provided banks with liquidity in the fourth

	    Banks received more liquidity through routine month-end
	payments by public authorities as well as expansionary market
	factors than was lost through the 2.3 billion mark rise in cash

	GERMAN MONEY MARKET SPLIT ON LOWER RATE PROSPECTS
TOPICS:

CONTENT:
	Remarks by central bankers raised some
	hopes the Bundesbank will cut rates on securities repurchase
	pacts, but operators remained divided on the likelihood of a
	move in the near term, money market dealers said.
	    Comments by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler yesterday
	that rate cuts were needed to curb money supply growth from
	speculative capital inflows, and by West Berlin state central
	bank president Dieter Hiss that there was no natural lower
	limit to the discount rate had, however, no immediate impact.
	    Call money declined to 3.65/75 pct from 3.75/85 pct but the
	drop was tied to extra liquidity in the market, dealers said.
	    Dealers said the Bundesbank's latest liquidity allotment
	this week dashed some hopes of lower rates.
	    The Bundesbank allotted only 6.1 billion marks yesterday in
	new liquidity in a repurchase pact at an unchanged rate of 3.80
	pct, thus subtracting some 8.8 billion marks from the market,
	as an outgoing 14.9 billion pact expired.
	    But some dealers said the smaller volume awarded by the
	pact was in line with present liquid money market conditions,
	and did not exlude a cut in the repurchase pact rate soon to
	3.70 pct if money market rates continue at present levels.
	    The next opportunity for the Bundesbank to lower rates on
	repurchase pacts will be in a tender expected next Tuesday.
	    Bundesbank officials have already said they favour more
	discreet rate adjustments through repurchase pacts, rather than
	the more public adjustment of leading rates.
	    The Bundesbank may either set a fixed allocation rate and
	allow banks to tender for the volume, as has been the case
	since it lowered its discount rate January 22, or else it may
	allow banks to tender for the rate and set the volume itself.
	    Dealers expect volume of the tender to be lower than the
	15.2 billion marks flowing out, to offset other incoming funds.
	    Some seven billion marks is expected to flow in next week.
	This should then flow back into the market as it is deposited
	with banks.
	    Banks were well supplied with liquidity, holding 61.5
	billion marks in reserves at the Bundesbank on Tuesday.
	    Holdings of average daily reserves over the first seven
	days of April stood at 59.6 billion marks, still above the
	estimated 51 billion required for all of April.

	The net position of federal states
	worsened in the first March week, cutting public authority net
	holdings at the Bundesbank by 500 mln marks, the central bank
	said.
	    States' cash deposits at the central bank fell to 800 mln
	and they also drew down 1.2 billion marks in book credit, 900
	mln marks more than in the prior week.
	    By contrast, however, the federal government was able to

	to 900 mln.
	    Despite the stronger states' net needs in the week, their
	cash position and other market dependent influences just about
	balanced the outflow of liquidity from the money market through
	an increase in cash in circulation, the Bundesbank said.
	    Cash in circulation rose by 1.4 billion marks in the week
	to 122.9 billion.
	    Liquidity also came in through the maturing of short-term
	treasury bills bought from the Bundesbank in the prior week.
	    Gross currency reserves rose in the week by 400 mln marks
	to 109.9 billion. Foreign liabilities of the Bundesbank were
	largely unchanged at 22.8 billion marks, giving a rise in net

	GERMAN CALL MONEY EASES AFTER LIQUIDITY INJECTION

	Call money eased to 3.75/80 pct from
	3.80/85 yesterday following a net injection of 6.7 billion
	marks at a rate of 3.80 pct in fresh funds from this week's
	securities repurchase agreement, dealers said.
	    But rates were expected to rise toward the end of the week.
	    A major tax payment period by banks on behalf of customers,
	payments for the federal railways loan stock and repayments of
	mark liabilities incurred by foreign central banks with the
	Bundesbank in the framework of the European Monetary System
	(EMS) are likely to significantly burden the system. Banks
	built up minimum reserves today, ahead of the expected outflow.
	    The Bundesbank credited banks with a gross 15.2 billion
	marks, but some 8.5 billion left the system at the same time as
	an earlier securities repurchase pact matured.
	    Dealers estimated the EMS related outflow as high as six
	billion marks.
	    The Bundesbank declined to comment, but a spokesman said
	yesterday although the funds now due may be allowed to roll
	over, the possibility that other central banks may choose to
	redeem them meant a net infusion was needed.
	    Dealers forecast tax payments of 25 and 30 billion marks,
	but much of it is expected to burden the system only next week.
	    Banks' minimum reserve holdings at the Bundesbank totalled
	53.6 billion marks on Monday, averaging 54.0 billion over the
	first nine days of March.
	    Dealers said although the figure was well above an expected
	requirement of around 51 billion marks, the expected outflow of
	funds was so large that banks might find it difficult to meet
	the requirement toward the end of March.
	    No securities repurchase agreement is expiring next week,
	but dealers said the Bundesbank could offer fresh liquidity if
	conditions significantly tighten. "The Bundesbank wants to keep
	rates around 3.80 pct," one dealer said.

	Call money firmed to about 3.65 pct,
	back to yesterday's 3.60/70 pct, from around 3.55 pct earlier
	today after the Bundesbank announced a tender for a new
	securities repurchase pact, dealers said.
	    The Bundesbank offered funds over 28 days at 3.80 pct,
	unchanged from the rate on recent facilities.
	    Many traders had expected the tender rate to come down in
	line with market rates for call money.
	    When this did not happen, because of more than adequate
	liquidity, many participants decided to withdraw funds from the
	market and use them to build up minimum reserves further.
	    This resulted in the slight rise in call money.
	    Banks held 58.9 billion marks at the Bundesbank on April 5,
	averaging 59.3 billion over the first five days of the month,
	well clear of the likely 51 billion mark minimum reserve
	requirement, dealers said.
	    There was therefore some surprise that the Bundesbank was
	offering more funds above the call money rate.
	    But some dealers noted that the rate on the 28 day facility
	was in line with one month money, which traded at 3.80/85 today
	after 3.80/90 yesterday and 3.90/4.00 on April 1.
	    Given market liquidity dealers said banks were likely to
	bid, and the Bundesbank allocate, less than the 14.9 billion
	marks draining from the market tomorrow when an earlier pact
	expires.
	    One dealer expected some 10 billion marks to be allocated.
	    Some dealers said the Bundesbank would have been unwilling
	to cut rates on this pact, as it is the first under its faster
	and more flexible tender process and because a lower rate might
	have been associated with the new system.
	    Dealers said they still thought the Bundesbank would over
	the next month lower the call money range from the narrow
	3.6-3.8 and broad 3.5-4.0 pct it has held recently.

	BUNDESBANK SEEN STEERING STEADY MONETARY COURSE
TOPICS:
	money-fx, interest
PLACES:

CONTENT:
	The Bundesbank is likely to steer a
	steady monetary course over the next few weeks and a change in
	credit policies is not expected at tomorrow's regular central
	bank council meeting, bank economists and dealers said.
	    "There is no need for action," Hermann Remsperger, chief
	economist of Berliner Handels- and Frankfurter Bank (BHF) said.
	    Others noted that exchange rates are stable after last
	month's Group of Six agreement in Paris and central bank money
	stock growth is still well above the three to six pct target
	zone, so a change in credit policies could be ruled out.
	    One money market dealer said comments by Bundesbank
	President Karl Otto Poehl at a private seminar in Duesseldorf
	two weeks ago hinting at another interest rate cut only
	indicated the Bundesbank might act if conditions changed.
	    Bank economists said U.S. Pressure on West Germany to
	further ease credit policies had receded since the Paris pact.
	    But such demands could re-emerge if West Germany failed to
	stimulate its economy enough to affect the massive U.S. Trade
	deficit.
	    Remsperger said continued strong money supply growth also
	precluded a further cut in official interest rates.
	    Central bank money stock was growing at an annualized 7.5
	pct in February, unchanged from the 7.5 pct in January.
	    Economists said some of the 18 members of the central bank
	council were worried about the continued overshoot in the money
	supply target and were bound to resist any moves to cut rates.
	But Poehl played down the risk of inflation.
	    Economists said the fact that money stock growth remained
	stable last month was a success. Some said it was likely to
	return to within the target range later this year.
	    "The special factors which boosted money supply growth last
	year are disappearing," one economist said.
	    He said some 75 pct of the money supply increase in 1986
	was caused by a sharp rise in the inflow of foreign funds.
	    This trend had been reversed recently and with domestic
	credit demand likely to remain at steady levels, money stock
	growth was expected to narrow in the medium-term.
	    These developments were increasing the Bundesbank's scope
	for a rate cut in the medium-term, economists said.
	    Money market dealers said period rates remained little
	changed, indicating no change in credit policy was expected.
	    Call money rates declined to 3.75/80 pct from 3.90/95
	yesterday, with the market well stocked with liquidity.
	    Dealers said call money was soft because tax payments on
	behalf of customers had been less than expected so far. But
	rates were likely to tighten again as soon as the full effect
	of this month's major tax payment period is felt. Payments for
	the federal railways bond are also likely to burden the market.
	    The Bundesbank did not inject liquidity via a securities
	repurchase agreement this week, but countered a tightening in
	rates on Monday by injecting funds through government-owned
	banks.
	    Dealers said recent securities repurchase pacts had shown
	the Bundesbank clearly wanted call money rates stable at 3.80.
	    One dealer said, "If the central bank wanted lower interest
	rates, it would first of all drive call money rates down."
	    Banks remained relatively well stocked with minimum reserve
	assets. They held 52.9 billion marks in minimum reserves on
	Monday, averaging 53.7 billion marks over the first 16 days of
	March. A requirement of around 51 billion is expected.

	GERMAN WAGE ROUND SAID TO LIMIT MONETARY OPTIONS
TOPICS:

PLACES:

CONTENT:
	The Bundesbank's options for West
	Germany monetary policy are limited for the foreseeable future
	by the delicate stage of wage negotiations between unions and
	employers, economists and money market dealers said.
	    Call money fell in quite active trading today, dropping to
	3.40/50 pct from 3.55/65 pct yesterday, and below the 3.50 pct
	treasury bill rate as a difficult month-end approached.
	    But dealers and economists said the Bundesbank was unlikely
	to encourage lower rates in the foreseeable future largely for
	fear of upsetting the current wage round.
	    One money market dealer for a major foreign bank said, "I
	don't think the Bundesbank wants rates to go up whatever
	happens. But it also does not want them to fall. Above all it
	wants to wait to see how the unions wage round goes."
	    In West Germany, unions and employers prepare the ground
	for triennial wage negotiations based on detailed assessments
	of growth and inflation, economists said.
	    Ute Geipel, economist with Citibank AG, said if the
	Bundesbank became more accommodating in monetary policy,
	raising fears in some quarters of a return in inflation in the
	medium term, unions would be obliged to curtail wage demands.
	    As a result the Bundesbank was concerned to make no move
	that would interfere in the negotiating process, Geipel said.
	    In the current round, the country's most powerful union,
	the IG Metall representing metalworkers and engineers, is
	demanding a shortening of the working week to 35 hours from the
	present 38-1/2 and an accompanying five pct increase in wages.
	    The engineering employers' association, Gesamtmetall, is
	offering to bring in a 38-hour-week from July 1, 1988, and give
	a two stage wage increase -- a 2.7 pct rise from April 1 this
	year and another 1.5 pct from July 1, 1988.
	    The agreement forged by IG Metall -- Europe's largest
	union, with 2.5 mln members -- and the employers would set the
	benchmark for settlements in other industries such as the
	public sector, banks and federal post office. Negotiations
	began in December and unions are hopeful they may conclude by
	early April, ahead of the traditional holiday period in June.
	    Though many economists said the unions' current warning
	strikes and rhetoric were part of the negotiating strategy and
	would not lead to a repeat of 1984's damaging seven-week
	strikes, others said unions would not compromise greatly on
	their positions and there could still be conflict.
	    This could extend the length of time in which the
	Bundesbank would keep its activity low-key, economists said.
	    The money market head said the unions' humiliation by the
	protracted financial problems of the Neue Heimat cooperative
	housing venture would contribute to union obstinacy.
	    "The unions haven't forgotten that and they will put this
	squarely onto the account in the negotiations," he said.
	    In addition, the newly-elected chairman of the IG Metall
	union, Franz Steinkuehler, was more radical and determined than
	his predecessor Hans Meyer and may be set for a longer battle
	to achieve the best possible settlement for his membership.
	    More than 16,000 engineering workers at 45 firms, mainly in
	south Germany, held warning strikes lasting up to two hours
	yesterday. Firms hit included Zahnradfabrik Passau GmbH and
	aerospace group Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm GmbH.
	    Today, 28,000 employees from 110 companies came out in
	warning strikes, a statement from IG Metall said.
	    Money market dealers said that overnight call money rates
	would rise in the near future in any case and did not depend on
	a politically-inhibited Bundesbank.
	    About eight billion marks were coming into the market
	tomorrow from salary payments by the federal government.
	    As a result, some banks fell back on the Bundesbank's offer
	to mop up liquidity via the sale of three-day treasury bills,
	anticipating still lower rates before the month-end.
	    But a pension payment date by banks on behalf of customers
	was due on Monday, other dealers noted. If banks were short of
	liquidity until the bills matured on Tuesday, rates could soar,
	perhaps to the 5.50 pct Lombard ceiling.
	    Banks were well stocked up with funds, having an average
	52.1 billion marks in Bundesbank minimum reserves in the first
	24 days of March, well above the 50.7 billion requirement.

	    Dealers said they expected rates to remain within a 3.70 to

	payments were unlikely to tighten rates significantly.
	    Next Wednesday, 14.9 billion marks are leaving the system

	they expected the Bundesbank to fully replace the outflow with
	a new tender at a fixed rate of 3.80 pct.
	    Commerzbank AG's management board chairman Walter Seipp
	called on the Bundesbank to reduce interest rates to protect
	the mark through bringing the allocation rate for securities
	repurchase agreements down.
	    But dealers said the Bundesbank was unlikely to ease credit
	policies at the moment. There was little domestic and foreign
	pressure for lower rates and no signs of a change.
	    Yesterday one or two large West German banks effectively
	drained the domestic money market of liquidity in order to
	achieve higher rates from their overnight deposits, dealers
	said.
	    Bundesbank figures showed banks held an average daily 50.7
	billion marks in minimum reserves at the central bank over the
	first 30 days of March, the exact requirement needed just one
	day before the end of the month.
	    Actual holdings on Monday were 42.0 billion marks.
	    Because rates soared to the level of the Lombard emergency

	draw down a high 5.3 billion marks in an attempt to meet
	Bundesbank needs, the data showed.

	GERMAN INSTITUTES WARN ON MONEY SUPPLY

CONTENT:
	Four of West Germany's five leading
	economic research institutes warned that excessive monetary
	growth threatened a resurgence of inflation.
	    But in a dissenting view the DIW institute in West Berlin,
	echoing recent statements by leading Bundesbank officials, said
	the expansion seen over the last 1-1/2 years did not
	necessarily threaten stability.
	    The five institutes issued a joint spring report, in which
	three -- Kiel, Hamburg and Essen -- forecast a two pct rise in
	GNP in 1987, while West Berlin and Munich predicted one pct.
	    The four institutes said an expansive policy was welcome in
	view of the slowdown in economic activity. But experience has
	shown that strong monetary growth eventually leads to a price
	rise which undoes the beneficial effects of monetary policy.
	    Given virtual zero inflation in West Germany such fears may
	seem exaggerated, they said.
	    "But it has often turned out in the past that the price
	climate can quickly deteriorate, forcing the central bank into
	a restrictive policy," they said.
	    The economic costs of a preventive stability policy are
	less than fighting inflation once it has taken hold, they said.
	    The four institutes disputed the view that monetary
	expansion would slow of its own accord in 1987 as domestic
	investors switch liquidity into longer term capital market
	investments following lower interest rates.
	    "Such redispositions may temporarily dampen the expansion of
	central bank money stock, but do not automatically lead to a
	smaller expansion of money supply," they said.
	    A return to growth and stability did not require
	spectacular central bank moves, but could be done quietly with
	open market operations and repurchase pacts, which would avoid
	an interest rate rise by dampening inflationary expectations.
	    The DIW institute said monetary policy should not be
	focused simply on growth of production potential. Because of
	uncertainty about exchange rate developments and economic
	weakness other factors should be taken into account.
	    Monetary policy should aim for further interest rate cuts
	and avoid rises to boost the economy and discourage revaluation
	speculation. Recent strong monetary expansion was not a threat
	in itself to price stability.
	    The 1979/81 inflation following strong 1977/78 money growth
	reflected other causes, such as rising oil prices and the
	falling mark.

	    The meeting came after Baker criticised West Germany for
	increasing short-term money market interest rates. He had said
	the rise was not in line with the spirit of the Louvre accord
	aimed at stabilizing the U.S. dollar last February.
	    The meeting had been arranged last week, the spokesman
	said. Baker, Stoltenberg and Poehl had agreed to pursue the
	policies agreed under the Louvre pact with reference to
	currency stability and monetary policy.
	    Earlier on Monday the Bundesbnak injected liquidity into
	the West German money market in a move which money market
	dealers interpreted as an attempt by the West German monetary
	authority to curb interest rate rises.
	    The spokesman described Monday's talks, which he called
	private, as very positive.

	GERMAN CALL MONEY RISES ON PENSION PAYMENTS
TOPICS:
	
PLACES:

	Call money rose to 3.70/80 pct from
	3.50/60 pct in moderate business as liquidity drained from the
	system on pension payments by insurance firms, dealers said.
	    But the market was relatively liquid for the month's end,
	when rates usually tighten, dealers said. Call money was still
	at or slightly below the 3.80 pct rate set on the most recent
	Bundesbank securities repurchase offer last week.
	    The insurances would probably draw down some 11 billion
	marks for pension payments. But part of this would be offset by
	an estimated five to six billion marks flowing in from treasury
	bills bought from the Bundesbank on Thursday, dealers said. 
	    Rates could ease later in the week as bank customers
	deposit part of their pension payments back with the banks
	tomorrow and Wednesday, and banks face reserve requirements for
	a new month, dealers said.
	    On Thursday, banks' actual daily reserve holdings fell to
	43.3 billion marks, down substantially from 49.1 billion on
	Wednesday. But the daily average holdings for the first 25 days
	of the month stood at 51.8 billion marks, well above the
	required daily average net reserve holdings of 50.7 billion.    
	The Bundesbank has not scheduled a securities repurchase
	tender this week, since there is no expiring prior pact. 
	dealers said liquidity was adequate without the addition of new
	repo funding.
	    If tightness does occur the Bundesbank may add short-term
	temporary federal government funds to counteract this. The last
	such liquidity injection was carried out as call money rates
	rose above 4.00 pct earlier this month, dealers said.

	BUNDESBANK ALLOCATES 6.1 BILLION MARKS IN TENDER

	The Bundesbank accepted bids for 6.1
	billion marks at today's tender for a 28-day securities
	repurchase pact at a fixed rate of 3.80 pct, a central bank
	spokesman said.
	    Banks, which bid for a total 12.2 billion marks liquidity,
	will be credited with the funds allocated today and must buy
	back securities pledged on May 6.
	    Some 14.9 billion marks will drain from the market today as
	an earlier pact expires, so the Bundesbank is effectively
	withdrawing a net 8.1 billion marks from the market with
	today's allocation.
	    A Bundesbank spokesman said in answer to enquiries that the
	withdrawal of funds did not reflect a tightening of credit
	policy, but was to be seen in the context of plentiful
	liquidity in the banking system.
	    Banks held an average 59.3 billion marks at the Bundesbank
	over the first six days of the month, well clear of the likely
	April minimum reserve requirement of 51 billion marks.
	    The Bundesbank spokesman noted that by bidding only 12.2
	billion marks, below the outgoing 14.9 billion, banks
	themselves had shown they felt they had plenty of liquidity.
	    Dealers said the Bundesbank is keen to prevent too much
	liquidity accruing in the market, as that would blunt the
	effectiveness of the security repurchase agreement, its main
	open-market instrument for steering market interest rates. Two
	further pacts are likely this month over the next two weeks.
	    The Bundesbank is currently steering call money between 3.6
	and 3.8 pct, although short-term fluctuations outside that
	range are possible, dealers said.
