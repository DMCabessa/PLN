	Necochea and fell one to 88 at Parana River ports.
	    Sorghum from Bahia Blanca increased 0.50 Australs to 76.50
	per tonne and dropped one to 75 at Rosario.
	    It was quoted at 75 at Villa Constitucion, San Nicolas and
	Puerto Alvear.
	    Oats were unchanged at 168 per tonne at Buenos Aires.
	    Millet from Buenos Aires and Rosario rose five per tonne to

	ARGENTINE SOYBEAN YIELD ESTIMATES DOWN FURTHER

CONTENT:
	Argentine grain producers again
	reduced their estimates for the total yield of the 1986/87
	soybean crop, which will begin to be harvested in mid-April,
	trade sources said.
	    They said growers now forecast soybean production this
	season at between 7.5 and 7.8 mln tonnes, down from last week's
	estimate of 7.7 to eight mln tonnes and the 8.0 to 8.4 mln
	tonnes forecast in mid-February.
	    The new forecast is still higher than last season's record
	total production.
	    Private sources put 1985/86 production at a record 7.2 to
	7.3 mln tonnes -- 4.2 to 6.4 pct lower than the new forecast
	for the current crop. The official figure for 1985/86 is 7.1
	mln tonnes, 5.6 to 9.9 pct below this season's new estimates.
	    Growers in the past week discovered more empty soybean pods
	in the main producing areas of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe
	provinces and northern Buenos Aires.
	    The crop since January has been hit by high temperatures
	and inadequate rainfall. Growers fear they may find more empty
	pods and have to further reduce their forecasts of total yield.
	    The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 to
	3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct higher than the 1985/86
	record of 3.34 mln hectares.
	    The state of the crop continued to be good in general until
	last week but intense, heavy rains since could have caused
	damage in areas where rainfall was higher than 100 mm.
	    Where the rains were less heavy they were considered
	beneficial although too late to improve yield estimates.
	    The rains also benefitted maize and sorghum crops in
	southern Buenos Aires province but are not expected to
	influence production forecasts.
	    In other areas, especially western Buenos Aires, where
	rainfall was more than 200 mm, parts of the sunflower, maize
	and sorghum crops not yet harvested may have been damaged.
	    The coarse grain crop harvest was interrupted last week by
	rains which also reached over 100 mm in parts of Cordoba, La
	Pampa and Santa Fe and almost 90 mm in parts of Entre Rios.
	    The area sown with maize this season was between 3.58 and
	3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct less than the 3.85 mln
	hectares in 1985/86.
	    The yield of 1986/87 maize continued to be forecast at
	between 9.9 and 10.1 mln tonnes.
	    This estimate is 19.8 to 20.2 pct lower than the 12.4 to
	12.6 mln tonnes at which private sources put 1985/86 production
	and 21.1 to 22.7 pct lower than the official 12.8 mln tonnes.
	    The sunflowerseed harvest has covered 23 to 26 pct of the
	area sown and continues in parts of central Buenos Aires
	although at a standstill elsewhere due to rain and floods.
	    A resumption of full harvesting and assessment of damage is
	impossible until rains stop and a spell of a week to 10 days of
	sunshine dries the fields.
	    The area sown this season was 2.0 to 2.2 mln hectares, down
	29.9 to 36.3 pct on last year's record 3.14 mln hectares.
	    Sunflowerseed 1986/87 production is still forecast at 2.3
	to 2.6 mln tonnes, 34.1 to 41.5 pct below the 1985/86 record of
	4.1 mln tonnes.
	    The grain sorghum harvest was the least affected by the
	rains, advancing steadily in Santa Fe and Cordoba and starting
	in La Pampa to cover 14 to 16 pct of the total area sown.
	    The area sown was 1.23 to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2
	pct less than the 1.45 mln hectares the previous season.
	    Yield estimates remained at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes, 16.7 to
	22 pct down on 1985/86 production of 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes.

	FURTHER ARGENTINE COARSE GRAIN LOSSES FEARED
TOPICS:

PLACES:
	argentina
CONTENT:
	Argentine grain producers adjusted
	their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop
	downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the
	end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said.
	    They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates
	had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which
	has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas.
	    However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend,
	producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain
	could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season.
	    Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27
	millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in
	Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in
	Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa.
	    There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa.
	    Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce
	rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the
	crops, including soybean.
	    However, as the lands began drying later in the week
	harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40
	pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower.
	    Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested
	material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield
	estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again.
	    The season's sunflowerseed production is now forecast at
	2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast
	last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of
	4.1 mln.
	    Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9
	to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season.
	    Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area
	sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will
	begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April.
	    Production estimates for maize were down from last week at
	9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated
	previously.
	    This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln
	tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and
	21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln
	tonnes.
	    Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to
	seven pct down on last season's 3.85 mln.
	    Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in
	Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and
	Buenos Aires in mid-April.
	    The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3
	to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season.
	    The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln
	tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week,
	and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last season's 4.1 mln to 4.2
	mln tonne crop.
	    The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted,
	remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5
	pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for
	1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of
	7.1 mln.
	    The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln
	to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln
	sown in 1985/86.
	    The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some
	areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some
	experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas
	making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on
	this were not available.
	    Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which
	will be sown between May and August or September, has so far
	not been as intense as in previous years.

	MORE HEAVY RAINS IN ARGENTINE GRAIN AREAS
TOPICS:
	grain, corn, sorghum, sunseed, oilseed
PLACES:
	argentina
CONTENT:
	Heavy rains fell again in
	Argentina's main grain growing areas in the week to yesterday,
	trade sources said.
	    Rains fell heaviest early in the week, and in particularly
	high volume in Buenos Aires province, Cordoba, La Pampa and
	Santa Fe provinces.
	    Rainfall totalled between 20 and 290 mm in Buenos Aires,
	heaviest in western sectors of the province, 20 to 145 mm in La
	Pampa, 25 to 120 mm in Cordoba, and 10 to 75 mm in Santa Fe.
	Rainfall was lighter in other provinces.
	    Rainfall totalled from five to 50 mm in Corrientes, five to
	31 mm in San Luis, five to 30 mm in Entre Rios, three to 20 mm
	in Misiones, 11 to 17 mm in Formosa and one to eight mm in
	Chaco.
	    Growers said it was still too early to tell whether the
	rains had damaged crops, though they said maize and sunflower
	crops may have suffered.
	    Harvesting of both those crops and sorghum was paralysed by
	the bad weather. For harvesting to resume as normal, the rains
	would have to stop long enough for the soil to dry and allow
	farm machinery to operate.
	    The rains caused flooding in western and northwestern
	Buenos Aires, as more than 750 mm have fallen in some areas
	there since February 23 while the annual average is 1,200 mm.
	    Flooded areas total between 1.2 and 1.5 mln hectares,
	Buenos Aires province governor Alejandro Armendariz said after
	flying over the flooded area.
	    Agriculture Secretary Ernesto Figueras said only 500,000
	hectares of the area now flooded had been planted, and that
	200,000 to 300,000 hectares could be lost. Growers said large
	parts of the flooded areas were not planted because they are
	low-lying and flood easily.
	    Trade sources said it was certain crops were damaged by the
	heavy rains but it was too early to tell the exact extent of
	the damage. They said it was likely rain combined with high
	winds uprooted many sunflower and maize plants.
	    The sunflower harvest moved forward in the centre and south
	of Cordoba and Santa Fe and got underway in a few isolated
	areas of northern Buenos Aires. Growers have harvested between
	15 and 18 pct of total planted area, up from seven to nine pct
	a week ago.
	    Estimates of the total volume of the sunflower crop were
	revised downward in light of the bad weather.
	    Estimates for total crop ranged from 2.3 to 2.6 mln tonnes,
	down from 2.4 to 2.7 mln tonnes estimated last week and down
	34.1 to 41.5 pct from last year's record harvest of 4.1 mln
	tonnes.
	    Maize harvesting also advanced, reaching between 13 and 15
	pct of total planted area compared to seven to nine pct a week
	ago. The maize harvest is expected to total between 10 and 10.2
	mln tonnes, down from the 10 to 10.4 mln tonnes estimated a
	week ago.
	    Last year's maize harvest totalled 12.8 mln tonnes,
	according to official figures.
	    Soybean production estimates were revised downward, to 7.8
	to 8.2 mln tonnes compared to estimates of eight to 8.4 mln
	tonnes a week ago. Last year's soybean harvest totalled 7.1 mln
	tonnes, according to official figures.
	    Sorghum harvesting moved slowly forward, reaching between
	four and six pct of total planted area, compared to two to four
	pct a week ago.
	    Sorghum production estimates remained steady at 3.2 to 3.5
	mln tonnes, down 16.7 to 22 pct from the 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes
	produced in the last harvest.

CONTENT:
	Argentine grain growers reduced
	their estimates for maize and soybean production in the current
	harvest in the week to yesterday, trade sources said.
	    Soybean production for 1986/87 is now estimated to reach
	between 7.7 and eight mln tonnes, versus 7.8 to 8.2 mln tonnes
	estimated a week ago and eight to 8.4 mln tonnes estimated in
	mid-February.
	    But even the lowest of those estimates would be 8.5 to 12.7
	pct greater than last year's total of 7.1 mln tonnes, according
	to official figures, and would be a new record.
	    The total area planted with soybeans for this harvest was a
	record 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares and increased 10.8 to 13.8 pct
	compared to the 3.3 mln hectares planted last year.
	    The change in yield estimates is due to very high
	temperatures and inadequate rainfall since early in the year in
	the soybean-producing belt of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe and
	northern Buenos Aires province.
	    The heat and lack of rain combined to leave many soybean
	pods empty, especially in Cordoba.
	    Intense rains in recent weeks did not affect crops, since
	rainfall was slight in most main soybean-producing areas.
	    Rains in the week to yesterday were isolated and weak in
	Buenos Aires province, totalling between one and 10 mm. There
	was no recorded rain in other grain-producing provinces.
	    With clear skies and seasonable temperatures, fields were
	able to dry in areas that had received heavy rains in recent
	weeks, allowing growers to accelerate the pace of maize,
	sunflower and sorghum harvesting.
	    Crops were considered in generally good condition, though
	it is still too early to judge whether the intense rains of
	recent weeks caused any long-term damage.
	    The maize harvest advanced to between 20 and 22 pct of the
	total area planted, compared to 13 to 15 pct a week ago.
	    Total area planted with maize for this harvest stood at
	3.58 to 3.78 mln hectares, down two to seven pct from the 3.85
	mln hectares planted in the previous harvest.
	    Total production for the current maize harvest is expected
	to reach between 9.9 and 10.1 mln tonnes, versus 10 to 10.2 mln
	tonnes estimated a week ago. The new figure is 21.1 to 22.7 pct
	lower than the 12.8 mln tonnes produced in the last harvest,
	according to official figures.
	    The sunflower harvest advanced to between 20 and 23 pct of
	total planted area, versus 15 to 18 pct a week ago.
	    Total area planted with sunflower for this harvest was two
	to 2.2 mln hectares, or 29.9 to 36.3 pct lower than the record
	3.14 mln hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest.
	    The current harvest's volume was again expected to be
	between 2.3 and 2.6 mln tonnes, or 34.1 to 41.5 pct lower than
	last harvest's record 4.1 mln tonnes.
	    Yields varied widely from area to area, and growers feared
	that heavy rains in recent weeks may have taken their toll on
	crops and, consequently, on total production volume.
	    The sorghum harvest reached between nine and 11 pct of
	total planted area, compared to four to six pct a week ago.
	    Total area planted with sorghum stood at between 1.2 and
	1.3 mln hectares, or 10.3 to 15.2 pct lower than the 1.4 mln
	hectares planted in the previous harvest.
	    Estimates for total sorghum production this harvest
	remained at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes again this week, or 16.7 to
	22 pct lower than last harvest's total volume of 4.1 to 4.2 mln
	tonnes.

	Fresh, heavy rains caused further
	damage to the Argentine 1986/87 coarse grains crop in the week
	to yesterday, particularly in Buenos Aires province, trade
	sources said.
	    They said the sunflower, maize, soybean and sorghum crops
	were damaged and yield estimates affected. New production
	forecasts were made for all these crops.
	    The rains over the weekend and up to yesterday registered
	more than 200 mm on average in western Buenos Aires and
	worsened the flooding in various parts of the province.
	    The weather bureau said the rains, which in Buenos Aires
	have surpassed 750 mm in the last 30 days, could continue.
	    The northeast of the country was also hit by heavy rains.
	    In Corrientes province the rains also passed an average of
	200 mm in some parts, notably the Paso de los Libres area
	bordering on Uruguay.
	    In Santa Fe and Entre Rios provinces they were over 100 mm
	in places, in Misiones and San Luis 90 mm and in Cordoba 80 mm.
	    The rains were less intense in Chaco and Formosa.
	    Harvesting in areas not actually under water could also be
	further delayed due to dampness in the earth, the sources said.
	    The excessive humidity might also produce rotting of the
	crops, further dimishing the yield, the sources added.
	    Sunflower harvesting before the weekend rains reached 26 to
	30 pct of the area sown in Santa Fe, Cordoba, La Pampa and
	Buenos Aires provinces.
	    The production forecast for 1986/87 sunflowerseed has been
	lowered to between 2.2 and 2.4 mln tonnes, against 2.3 to 2.6
	mln tonnes the previous week, making it 41.5 to 46.3 pct lower
	than the record 4.1 mln tonnes produced last season.
	    The area sown was two to 2.2 mln hectares, down 29.9 to
	36.3 pct on the record 3.14 mln hectares in 1985/86.
	    The maize harvest advanced to within 26 to 28 pct of the
	area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires. It
	will begin in La Pampa within about 10 days, weather
	permitting.
	    Maize yield this season is now estimated at 9.6 to 9.9 mln
	tonnes, against last week's 9.9 to 10.1 mln tonnes, down 21.4
	to 22.6 pct on the 12.4 to 12.6 mln tonnes at which private
	producers put 1985/86 production.
	    The new forecast is 22.7 to 25 pct down on the official
	figure of 12.8 mln tonnes for last season's production.
	    The grain sorghum harvest reached 17 to 19 pct of growers'
	targets, against 14 to 16 pct the previous week.
	    The production forecast was reduced to between three and
	3.3 mln tonnes, against 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes last week, 21.4
	to 26.8 pct down on last season's 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes.
	    The area sown with sorghum in 1986/87 was 1.23 to 1.30 mln
	hectares, down 10.3 to 15.2 pct on the 1.45 mln in 1985/86.
	    The forecast for soybean yield this season was the least
	changed in relation to last week. It was put at a record 7.5 to
	7.7 mln tonnes, against the previous 7.5 to 7.8 mln tonnes.
	    These figures are 4.2 to 5.5 pct higher than last season's
	record of 7.2 to 7.3 mln tonnes, according to private sources,
	and 5.6 to 8.5 pct up on the official 7.1 mln tonnes.
	    The adjustment to the production forecast is due to the
	rains and overcast conditions which have greatly reduced the
	sunlight needed for this crop, sources said.
	    Producers fear estimates may yet have to be adjusted down
	further.
	    The humidity could induce rotting and growers are still
	finding more empty pods due to excessively dry weather earlier
	in the season.
	    Soybean harvesting is due to start in mid-April in southern
	Cordoba and Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires.

	loan. An Argentine mission is now in the U.S. For talks with 11
	banks, seeking to win an easing of repayment terms and secure
	the loan.
	    Weizsaecker said Argentina has had difficulties with the
	European Community over trade barriers and subsidies for grain
	exports.
	    "We are making efforts to eliminate them with the help of
	balanced interest from all parties," he said.
	    Argentina has said the barriers and subsidies cut unfairly
	into the country's traditional markets for its grain exports.
	    Weizsaecker arrived for a four-day visit, opening a Latin
	American tour which includes Bolivia and Guatemala. He held
	brief talks on Sunday with Brazilian President Jose Sarney
	during a stopover in Brasilia.

	ARGENTINE CORN SALES TO USSR LOWER - USDA REPORT

CONTENT:
	Total corn sales by Argentina to the
	Soviet Union are only 1.5 to 1.8 mln tonnes, with delivery
	spread out from March to June, the U.S. Agriculture
	Department's Counselor in Buenos Aires said in a field report.
	    The report, dated March 27, said many sources have stated
	that the Soviet Union was initially interested in purchasing
	2.3 mln tonnes lof corn from Argentina.
	    However, Soviet purchases from the United States have
	tended to displace additional Argentine purchases, the report
	said.
	    The USDA has to date reported USSR purchases of 2.6 mln
	tonnes of U.S. corn for delivery in the current U.S.-USSR grain
	agreement year, which ends this September 30, it said.

	U.S. DRAFTS SANCTIONS IN ARGENTINA SOY CASE
TOPICS:
	oilseed, soybean
PLACES:
	usa, argentina
CONTENT:
	The U.S. is drafting options including
	possible trade retaliation against Argentina in a dispute over
	the differential between soybean and product  taxes which
	Buenos Aires levies on exports.
	    The drafting of retaliation options follows the failure
	of high-level talks earlier this month to resolve a case filed
	by the U.S. National Soybean Processors Association, U.S.
	officials said. The NSPA charged that Argentina's differential
	export taxes implicitly subsidize soyproduct exports in
	competition with the U.S.
	    "Our only option is some sort of retaliation to restrict
	(Argentine) access to our market," said one U.S. source.
	   
	    The U.S. shelved the NSPA case earlier this year after
	Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said Argentina agreed to
	end the differential.
	    But when Argentina announced export taxes for the 1987/88
	year in July, the differential was narrowed only one pct.
	    Deputy trade representative Michael Smith met Agriculture
	minister Ernesto Figuerras and Economy minister Juan Sourroille
	on September 29 and the Argentine officials said they could not
	narrow the differential further for 1987/88.
	    As a result of the impasse, the U.S. is considering
	restrictions on imports of items such as Argentine corned beef
	and finished leather, the U.S. sources said.
	    A decision on reprisals is likely to be made by the Reagan
	administration soon, they said.
