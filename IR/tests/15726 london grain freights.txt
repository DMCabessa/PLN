	Three London markets which trade potato,
	soymeal and meat futures said they will merge to form a new
	Agricultural Futures Exchange.
	    Legal advisers have been instructed to implement the
	amalgamation of the London Potato Futures Association, LPFA,
	the London Meat Futures Exchange, LMFE, and the Grain and Feed
	Trade Association's, GAFTA, Soya Bean Meal Futures Association,
	SOMFA. No timetable was given.
	    Members of the three exchanges have been consulted,
	Agricultural Futures Exchange secretary Bill Englebright told
	Reuters, and no objections have been raised to the merger.
	    Three markets are involved at present but the new exchange
	could ultimately combine five markets.
	    Discussions are taking place with the Baltic International
	Freight Futures Exchange, BIFFEX, and the GAFTA London Grain
	Futures Market is considering the possibility of joining the
	other markets, market officials said.
	    The BIFFEX board is expected to reach a decision on the
	merger at its meeting at the end of this month, after members
	are consulted at a meeting on March 16.
	    The grain futures market also intends to consult its
	members soon, GAFTA director general James Mackie said.
	    The aim of the amalgamation is to limit regulatory and
	administrative costs and achieve the recognition required under
	the 1986 Financial Services Act. This legislation requires a
	futures market to become a Recognised Investment Exchange, RIE,
	for trading to continue.
	    Representatives of all the futures markets on the Baltic
	Exchange have been discussing the possibility of a single RIE
	structure since the beginning of the year.
	    The new exchange now planned will apply to the Securities
	and Investments Board for recognition as an RIE "at the
	appropriate time," the Agricultural Futures Exchange said.
	    "This commitment by the markets will enable progress to be
	made to develop a stronger and more effective exchange to the
	benefit of all those involved in the industry," the chairman of
	the formation committee, Pat Elmer, said.
	    The merged markets will remain at the Baltic Exchange.

	The International Cocoa Organization buffer stock
	could face an uphill battle to halt the downtrend in world

	COMMODITY PACTS MORE ORIENTED TOWARDS MARKET
TOPICS:
	tin, sugar, grain, wheat, cocoa, coffee, rubber
PLACES:
	uk, usa, malaysia, canada, west-germany, france, brazil
CONTENT:
	Consuming countries, chastened by the
	collapse of International Tin Council (ITC) price support
	operations in 1985, are insisting more than ever before that
	commodity pacts reflect the reality of the markets they are
	serving, a Reuter survey showed.
	    They want price ranges to be more responsive to market
	trends - to avoid overstimulating output and straining the
	accords' support operations - and intervention rules that avoid
	the risk of exports by non-members undermining the pacts.
	Consumers and producers, mindful of ITC buffer stock losses,
	have also sought strict conditions for buffer operations.
	    Importers and some key exporting countries have shunned a
	generalised approach to commodity price stabilisation and
	prefer to assess each commodity case by case, the survey
	showed.
	    The International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) last week set
	precise limits on what the Buffer Stock Manager (BSM) could do
	under the new agreement. It imposed daily and weekly purchase
	limits, prohibited the BSM from operating on futures markets
	and stipulated, after consumer insistence, that up to 15 pct of
	total buffer stock purchases could be of non-member cocoa. This
	will help prevent lower quality cocoa from Malaysia, the
	world's fourth largest producer, undermining the market.
	    The cocoa pact establishes precise differentials the Buffer
	Stock Manager must use when purchasing varying grades.
	    A new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA) was
	adopted earlier this month in Geneva. Importing and exporting
	countries agreed several changes to make the reference price
	more responsive to market trends and they eliminated provisions
	under which the buffer stock could borrow from banks to finance
	operations. Direct cash contributions from members will fund
	buffer stock purchases. Bank financing was a particular feature
	of the failed ITC buffer stock which suffered losses running
	into hundreds of millions of sterling. Legal wrangles continue.
	    Recent International Coffee Organization (ICO) negotiations
	in London exemplified the degree to which consumers insist that
	agreements reflect market reality, commodity analysts said.
	    Consumers and a small group of producers argued that
	"objective criteria" should be used to define export quota
	shares, which would have meant a reduction in the share of
	Brazil, the world's leading producer. Brazil wanted to maintain
	its previous quota share of 30 pct. The talks broke down and,
	although an ICO executive board meeting starts in London today,
	delegates and trade sources see chances of any near term
	negotiations on export quota distribution as remote.
	    International agreements exist for sugar and wheat. These
	do not have any economic clauses but provide a forum for
	discussions on possible future economic agreements, collect
	statistics and draw up market analyses. Analysts said
	differences between sugar exporting countries have held up any
	progress towards an accord with economic teeth, while sheer
	competition between major exporters amid a world grain glut
	militate against any pact with economic provisions for wheat.
	    An alternative focus for commodity discussions are
	international study groups, made up of governments with advice
	from industry, such as those for lead and zinc and rubber.
	    The U.N. Common fund for commodities, with a planned
	directly contributed capital of 470 mln dlrs, has failed to
	become operational because neither the U.S. Nor the Soviet
	Union has ratified it. U.S. Officials in Washington said the
	U.S. Doubts the fund would be able to fulfil its objectives,
	citing the lack of widespread support.
	    U.S. Officials in Washington and Malaysian officials in
	Kuala Lumpur expressed a policy of looking at each commodity
	pact case by case. U.S. Officials said it has been willing to
	study individual cases for economically sound, market-oriented
	commodity accords balancing producer and consumer interests.
	    "We see little to be gained by attempting to increase the
	price of a commodity whose long-term trend is downward,"
	official Administration policy states. The U.S. Currently
	belongs to only two international commodity agreements that
	have economic clauses - the International Coffee Agreement
	(ICA) and INRA - but it is also a member of the sugar and wheat
	pacts.
	    The U.S. Did not join the International Cocoa Agreement
	because it considered its proposed price ranges unrealistic and
	not designed to protect the interests of consuming countries,
	the State Department said. U.S. Officials singled out the INRA
	as the one commodity agreement that seems to be working.
	    U.S. Negotiators were successful in getting other members
	of the pact to agree that the price review and adjustment
	mechanism of the rubber agreement would accurately reflect
	market trends and also to continue the accord as a market
	oriented agreement, U.S. Officials said.
	    Canadian officials in Ottawa also said they have
	consistently tried to look at membership of commodity pacts on
	the merits of each case. Malaysian Primary Industries Minister
	Lim Keng Yaik told Reuters in Kuala Lumpur his country, the
	world's top producer of rubber, tin and palm oil, decides its
	participation in international commodity pacts case by case.
	    Malaysia is a member of the Association of Tin Producing
	Countries (ATPC) which produce 65 pct of world tin. The ATPC
	launched a plan to limit member tin exports to 96,000 tonnes
	for a year from March to cut the tin surplus to 50,000 from
	70,000.
	    Economist in the West German Ministry of Agriculture and
	delegate to cocoa, wheat and sugar agreements Peter Baron told
	Reuters in London, "Agreements with economic clauses to
	stabilise prices could function if fixed price ranges were
	close to market reality, if there was full participation by
	producers and consumers, and if participants were prepared to
	take their obligations in the framework of the agreement
	seriously."
	    But Baron added, "No real sanctions are available for a
	country that doesn't stick to its obligations...The German
	approach is sceptical. We don't think agreements are the best
	instrument to help developing countries. They were never meant
	to be a vehicle for the transfer of resources and that is how
	developing countries often interpret them."
	    Traditionally Britain has always been supportive of
	commodity agreements, reflecting its strong links with Third
	World producing countries. But recently demands for more
	stringent and justifiable pacts with emphasis placed on the
	need for "intellectual honesty" and "objective criteria" have
	grown.
	    British officials stress the need for commodity pacts to be
	a two way partnership in trade rather than a disguise for aid.
	    It is now seen as essential that any pacts involving direct
	market participation through a buffer stock have a high degree
	of transparency and do not contain the risk of open-ended
	borrowing that occurred in the tin pact, they said. U.K.
	Delegates talk of stabilisation and the need for prices to
	reflect changes in market structure and price trends rather
	than dictate what prices should be.
	    A Foreign Ministry official in Tokyo said Japan urges price
	realism in commodity pacts, adding high prices inflate supply.
	    A government spokesman in Paris said France is favourable
	to commodity pacts. France, a large consumer and producer of
	sugar, favours a sugar pact as long as it reflects the real
	market situation, particularly regarding stocks.
	    Indonesia's Foreign Minister Mochtar Kusumaatmadja told
	Reuters in Jakarta: "These agreements can work as long as the
	problems are cyclical..But it's another matter when there are
	structural problems..But we are still committed to commodity
	agreements as an act of faith." Nicaraguan External Trade
	Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca said in London producers
	cannot afford not to give their backing to commodity
	agreements.
	    "The political will is not there on the part of some
	consumers to make agreements work," Martinez Cuenca said.
	    The head of the economics department in the Brazilian
	Foreign Ministry, Sebastiao do Rego Barros, told Reuters an
	agreement can be successful if it keeps a link with market
	reality. If you have an agreement such as coffee with a system
	of quotas, with a link between prices practised inside the pact
	and actual market prices, it can work. UNCTAD spokesman Graham
	Shanley said consuming countries realise steady export earnings
	enhance developing countries' ability to service debt and mean
	greater demand for industrialised nations' capital goods.
