	    An IBC spokesman told Reuters that a 15 mln dlr loan from

	in June, July and August to creditors.

	BRAZIL'S BANKWORKERS LAUNCH NATIONAL STRIKE
TOPICS:

CONTENT:
	Most of Brazil's 700,000 bankworkers
	began an indefinite national strike, union leaders said, as the
	country's labour troubles showed no signs of easing.
	    A national seamen's strike which began on February 27 is
	still continuing, despite a partial return to work.
	    A spokesman at the bankworkers' national strike
	headquarters in Sao Paulo, Lucio Cesar Pires, told Reuters that
	about 500,000 of Brazil's 700,000 bankworkers were on strike.
	    He said that many private banks were working, particularly
	in Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Porto Alegre.
	    The bankworkers, one of the best-organized sectors of
	Brazil's labour force, are striking for a 100 pct pay rise.
	    Pires said the strike had closed the state-controlled Banco
	do Brasil, which has more than 3,000 branches.
	    Brazil's current labour troubles stems from the collapse of
	the government's price freeze and the return of high inflation.
	    According to official figures, prices rose by 33 pct in
	just the first two months of the year.
	    Other strikes are being threatened, including national
	stoppages by 450,000 social security workers and 50,000
	university teachers.
	    In central Sao Paulo dozens of armed military police stood
	guard outside branches of the Banco do Brasil to preempt any
	move by bankworkers to occupy the buildings.
	    A bank official in one foreign bank, which was still open
	this morning, said that with the closure of the Banco do Brasil
	private banks would not be able to function much longer.
	    He said: "If the Banco do Brasil closes it shuts down the
	whole system. I think that after lunch we will have to stop."
	    Groups of strikers marched in the central commercial
	district, waving banners and stopping outside private banks to
	chant slogans.
	    Pires said the strike call had been largely ignored by
	workers in the private banks, with many branches open
	particularly in Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Porto Alegre.
	    Television reports said that in the southern state of
	Parana farmers protesting against high interest rates supported
	the bankworkers.
	    As they have done many times over the past few weeks, they
	blockaded the entrances of private banks with farm machinery.

	A nationwide bank strike launched
	yesterday by Brazilian bank workers gained more support today
	with the closure of the <Banco do Estado de Sao Paulo>
	(Banespa) in Sao Paulo, a union spokesman said.
	    The spokesman said about 530,000 of Brazil's 700,000 bank
	workers were on strike. He said the chief development since
	yesterday was the decision by the city's 20,000 Banespa workers
	to come out on strike. Banespa is the Sao Paulo state bank.
	    State-controlled <Banco do Brasil SA>, with over 3,000
	branches throughout the country, closed down yesterday.
	    Bank industry sources say the closure of the Banco do
	Brasil will soon force the shutdown of the many private banks
	which are not strike-bound.
	    The bankworkers are seeking an immediate pay rise of 100
	pct and monthly salary adjustments.
	    A spokesman for the National Federation of Banks, Adilson
	Lorente, said that yesterday only 30 pct of private banks'
	branches were strike-bound. He had no estimate of how many
	workers were on strike or any information on the percentage of

	Brazilian President Jose Sarney
	announced a move which temporarily legalises the purchase of
	U.S. dollars in the parallel currency market, aimed at
	promoting imports of foreign goods.
	    In a speech, Sarney justified his measure as a need to face
	"current well known difficulties to obtain foreign loans for the
	purchase of goods."
	    The parallel market, although officially tolerated, is
	technically illegal in Brazil. For the past year, the dollar in
	the parallel market has sold at between 25 and 100 pct above
	the official rate.
	    Sarney's decision means Brazilian importers of machinery
	and industrial equipment can buy dollar currency in the
	parallel market without having to wait for an official order
	from the Banco do Brasil's Foreign Trade Department (Cacex).
	    Sarney also announced measures to boost exports in an
	effort to strengthen the country's trade balance and alleviate
	the risk of a reduction of foreign loans for this sector of the
	economy.
	    The president authorised the National Foreign Trade Council
	(CONEX) to resume operating as the ruling body of Brazil's

	The trade surplus doubled in
	february to 261 mln dlrs from January's 129 mln, but was  below

	    The director of the Banco do Brasil's foreign trade

	February confirmed a rising trend in exports, which totalled
	1.53 billion dlrs against 1.26 billion in January and, after

	the same month last year.
	    Coffee earnings were down to 110 mln dlrs against 295 mln
	in February 1986 because of lower prices, he added.
	    Fendt said that although the February results were lower
	than the average expected for the rest of the year, the
	government's target of an eight-billion-dlr surplus for 1987
	should be achieved. This would compare with a 1986 surplus of
	9.5 billion dlrs.
	    Exports this year are expected to total 22.5 billion dlrs
	and imports 14.5 billion, he added. In 1986 exports totalled
	22.4 billion dlrs and imports 12.9 billion.
	    Fendt said the rise in imports in February to 1.27 billion
	dlrs from 1.12 billion in February last year was in line with
	government plans to foster economic growth.
	    Fendt said that imports were running at levels well above
	the traditional average for Brazil.
	    In the first two months of the year imports, excluding oil

	SARNEY MEETS BRAZIL BUSINESS LEADERS

CONTENT:
	President Jose Sarney, whose handling
	of the economy is under attack at home and abroad, has held
	private talks with Brazilian business leaders worried that
	government policies are leading to recession.
	    Over an informal barbecue at a farm outside Sao Paulo owned
	by millionaire entrepreneur Matias Machline, Sarney met more
	than 20 businessmen for discussion on Brazil's economic crisis.
	    Business leaders said before the meeting they would be
	pressing for less government interference in what they describe
	as a tightly regulated economy.
	    Their concerns include the country's high rates of interest
	and tough restrictions on imports.
	    Machline, president of the Sharp electronics group and a
	personal friend of Sarney's, told television reporters outside
	his farm that he wanted "less government participation in the
	economy."
	    When the government announced a month ago that it was
	suspending interest payments on Brazil's 68 billion dlr debt to
	commercial banks, it said this was a means of ensuring growth
	and avoiding recession.
	    But business leaders and economic analysts say there are
	growing signs that Brazil's economy, the eighth biggest in the
	non-communist world, is heading for a downturn after 8 pct
	growth last year.
	    Businessmen are deeply concerned about the effect on
	industry of import restrictions introduced earlier this year
	because of the country's deteriorating trade balance.
	    Cacex, the foreign trade department of the federally owned
	Banco do Brasil, has told companies they must limit their
	imports to 90 pct of what they imported in 1985.
	    Business sources say that in practice importing even this
	amount is difficult and they have to haggle with Cacex on a
	case-by-case basis.
	    The business daily Gazeta Mercantil reported that in many
	sectors of the economy there was a real fear that production
	lines would grind to a halt next month.
	    One of those attending the talks was Mario Amato, head of
	the powerful Sao Paulo State Industries' Federation (FIESP).
	    Business sources said he would argue that unless there were
	a relaxation in import controls a sharp downturn in industrial
	activity was inevitable.
	    Relations between Sarney and the business community have at
	times been strained and the existence of these tensions pointed
	up the importance of the meeting.
	    In one bizarre dispute in January, Sarney surprised
	Brazilian business leaders by declaring that they were allies
	of the 19th century anarchist Mikhail Bakunin. This outburst
	came after Amato warned that companies might start disobeying
	government regulations on price controls.
	    Brazilian press reports made much of the fact that Finance
	Minister Dilson Funaro, chief architect of the government's
	economic policy, had not been invited to the gathering.
