	The U.S. Agriculture Department said
	private U.S. exporters reported purchases from foreign sellers
	of 120,000 tonnes of wheat for delivery to unknown
	destinations.
	    The wheat, consisting of 60,000 tonnes of hard red winter
	and 60,000 tones of soft red winter, is for delivery during the
	1987/88 season, which begins June 1.
	    A purchase from a foreign seller is a transaction in which
	a U.S. exporter contracts to buy U.S.-produced commodities from
	a foreign firm, the department said.

	NY ANALYSTS SEE COFFEE FUTURES FALLING FURTHER
TOPICS:
	coffee
PLACES:
	usa
CONTENT:
	New York coffee futures prices will
	probably fall to about 85 cents a lb in the next month before a
	consolidation trend sets in, according to market analysts.
	    Yesterday, prices for the spot May contract fell below 1.00
	dlr a lb for the first time since August 1981 after the
	International Coffee Organization did not place new export
	quota discussions on its current agenda.
	    Talks aimed at renegotiating ICO export quotas, after five
	years of price-supporting agreements, broke down in February.
	    "Short-term, it looks like a definite test of 90 cents,
	perhaps 85 cents," said William O'Neill, coffee analyst with
	Elders Futures. "But the additional downside may not be all
	that great from current levels."
	    "At this price level the market is very vulnerable to
	bullish developments," O'Neill added. "Rather than us having a
	market that will plummet we'll kind of see prices erode --
	probably to around 85 cents."
	    "I definitely see 90 cents and would not rule out a brief
	drop to 85 cents," said Debra Tropp, a coffee analyst with
	Prudential Bache. But she said by June worries about a freeze
	in Brazil growing areas will become more of a market factor,
	with prices likely to consolidate ahead of that time.
	    A trader at a major international trade house, who asked
	not to be named, said he expects a 10 cent drop near term but
	believes if Brazil opens May registrations at a relatively high
	export price and requires a high contribution quota from
	exporters the market could steady at the lower levels.
	    Longer term, he added, producer pressure will mount on
	Brazil to agree to consumers' export quota terms, and a new
	international agreement could come into force next fall.
	    Since the February talks broke down, the market has fallen
	from about 130.00 cents a lb to a low of 98.10 cents a lb
	today, as buyers and sellers sought to reassess supply and
	demand.
	    Generally, analysts say, producers have a large buildup of
	stocks, but U.S. roasters have drawn down supplies and will
	need to do some buying soon.
	    "Most producing nations have just completed or are about to
	complete their annual harvests and exportable supplies are at
	their seasonal peak. Exports remain behind year ago and
	warehouses in producer nations are becoming increasingly
	overburdened," said Sandra Kaul, coffee analyst for Shearson
	Lehman, in that firm's forthcoming quarterly coffee report.
	    Kaul said producers' need to procure hard currency to
	service foreign debt will put further pressure on them to sell,
	and "this should keep substantial pressure on exporters to
	undertake sales despite the drop in prices to six year lows."
	    Kaul believes the market will drop to 80 cents a lb before
	Brazil's frost season begins in June.
	    Accurate assessments of roaster demand are hard to come by,
	though analysts note the peak winter consumption period is
	passed and demand usually slows this time of year.
	    Shearson's Kaul estimated U.S. roaster ending stocks as of
	January 31, including soluble and roasted, at 6.3 mln bags
	compared with 6.9 mln at end-September 1986, a small drawdown
	for the usually busy winter roasting season.
	    But Elders O'Neill said, "The roasters are not overstocked
	by any means."
	    Analysts said picking a bottom to the market is difficult,
	given the fact prices have fallen into uncharted territory
	below the long-term support at 1.00 dlr per lb, and several
	traders said the sidelines might be preferable for the short
	term.

	Several U.S. House members urged
	the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, to strengthen
	its proposed rules governing the sale of foreign futures and
	options in the U.S.
	      "I'm from the state of Illinois, and we don't want to see

	industry of the 1980s," Rep. Lane Evans (D-Ill.) told a hearing

	      U.S. exchanges have complained that the proposed
	regulations would give sellers of foreign futures an edge over
	domestic futures sellers because they would be subject to less
	rigorous requirements, especially in the area of capital.
	      Phillips said the commission has no way of requiring
	foreign markets to implement the same regulatory safeguards as
	in the U.S., but that the proposed rules would ensure marketing
	of foreign futures and options conform to U.S. requirements.
	     "If people want to enter into these (foreign) markets,
	they know they will not have the same regulations," she said.
	      Phillips said the commission would consider changes in

	TIN TRADERS' RESPONSE MUTED TO KL FUTURES MARKET
TOPICS:
	tin
PLACES:
	uk, japan, malaysia, brazil, china
CONTENT:
	European free market tin traders made a
	somewhat muted response to plans for a Kuala Lumpur
	dollar-based tin futures market due to be launched in October.
	    Traders said the new market would probably be a useful
	trading medium for Japan and other South East Asian tin
	interests although European traders generally appear to be
	reasonably satisfied with the current "free market" system
	which has been operating since London Metal Exchange, LME, tin
	trading ceased in October 1985. Dealers here will also want to
	see how acceptable foreign metal will be on the new market and
	what sort of demand develops for forward deliveries.
	    There is also a view among European traders that, while the
	proposed Kuala Lumpur tin futures market would provide another
	useful reference point, a market inaugurated by the Malaysian
	government -- in the past viewed as a major player at times by
	the trade -- would make participants uncomfortable.
	    Some traders expressed a preference for a resumption of
	trading on the London Metal Exchange, but they added that while
	there has been some behind the scenes discussion on the subject
	a definite move is unlikely until outstanding High Court
	litigation actions have been resolved.
	    Spot tin prices on the European free market are currently
	around 4,200 stg per tonne for high grade metal in warehouse
	Rotterdam. Over the past 18 months the price moved to a ten
	year low of 3,400 stg in March 1986 and rebounded to as high as
	4,680 stg in December 1986.
	    This compares with 8,140 stg last paid when LME trading
	ceased in October 1985 and a record high tin price of 10,350
	stg traded for Cash Standard Grade metal in June of that year.
	    LME warehouse stocks are now near a two-year low at 28,065
	tonnes, having fallen steadily from a record high of 72,485
	tonnes reached in February 1986.
	    Traders said the free market turned bullish during late
	last year based on producer forecasts of a supply/demand
	deficit of some 28,000/29,000 tonnes. Analysts were predicting
	prices of up to 5,000 stg per tonne during 1987.
	    However, the trend was reversed following a strong upswing
	in sterling versus the dollar and values fell back briefly to
	4,100 stg last month after approaching 4,700 stg in December.
	    The decline accelerated as producers who had sold very
	little metal at the higher levels became competitive sellers.
	    There was also a lack of significant demand from major
	steel mills who made large purchases prior to the new year.
	    Traders say the 15 ITC creditor banks' original tin
	holdings of nearly 45,000 tonnes have now been almost halved,
	and the bulk of material still available is being held by
	Malaysian and Japanese firms which are reluctant to depress the
	market with unwanted metal.
	    Some 80,000 tonnes were held by banks and brokers after the
	International Tin Council's, ITC, buffer stock manager halted
	support operations on the LME on behalf of the 22 members
	nations of the International Tin Agreement.
	    The overhang of metal was reduced further by broker
	Shearson Lehman Brothers, which earlier this year reported
	having sold its ITC-related holdings and halved its overall tin
	position.
	    Analysts see no immediate sign of a rally in European tin
	prices and movements are still expected to be largely related
	to currency fluctuations, unless significant consumer demand
	emerges for the third quarter.
	    The Association of Tin Producing Countries, ATPC, has made
	efforts since the collapse of the ITA to achieve higher world
	prices by attempting to bring all major producers under an
	export control umbrella, but to date Brazil and China, two
	major producers, remain unaffected by the ATPC argument and
	apparently are continuing to offer material at discounts to
	consumers in main European trading centres, dealers said.

	VOLATILITY LIKELY TO REMAIN LOW IN DEBT FUTURES
TOPICS:

PLACES:
	usa
CONTENT:
	Financial analysts see little chance
	that U.S. interest rate futures will break out of their narrow
	ranges and low volatility during the remainder of the week.
	    "We got a little volatility Wednesday," said Staley
	Commodities International analyst Jerome Lacey. "But for the
	moment we're still in a trading range."
	    Even unexpected developments concerning the growth of the
	U.S. economy may not be enough to spur the market out of its
	sluggish state, the analysts said.
	    "It (the bond market) has not yet demonstrated that it can
	break out of its very low volatility," said Carroll McEntee and
	McGinley analyst Denis Karnosky. "It needs something, but it's
	not going to be news about the economy," he said.
	    Karnosky said that the bond market will possibly break out
	of the doldrums if participants perceive that the dollar has
	stabilized and the Federal Reserve has more room to conduct
	monetary policy.
	    But even Wednesday, when fed funds were below six pct, the
	dollar strong and oil on the soft side, bond futures attracted
	eager sellers when contracts approached recent highs, he said.
	    In addition to a changing perception about the dollar and
	monetary policy, Golden Gate Futures president Norman Quinn
	said the beginning of April could bring foreign investors back
	into the marketplace.
	    "The market is beginning to feel there may be demand at the
	beginning of the fiscal year in Japan on April 1," Quinn said.
	    Quinn echoed the sentiment of many analysts that there are
	large amounts of cash waiting to be invested. If Japanese
	investment in U.S. securities does materialize at the start of
	Japan's fiscal year, domestic funds may also flow into the bond
	market, he said.
	    "We could get a stiff rally, possibly enough to bring
	yields on long bonds down to seven to 7-1/8 pct," compared to
	the current yield of about 7.5 pct, Quinn said.
	    In the meantime, even the prospect of new supply is not
	likely to move futures.
	    The Treasury's announcement of a 15 billion dlr refunding
	operation did little to move cash government securities prices
	late Wednesday after the close of futures.
	    "I'd be surprised if supply pushed us out of it (the
	trading range)," Lacey said.

	ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - DUTCH SHARE PROSPECTS MIXED

CONTENT:
	While world exchanges revel in a
	continuing securities boom, the Dutch stockmarket remains
	lacklustre despite a series of largely positive annual
	corporate results and signs of a more stable dollar, analysts
	said.
	    Prices and turnover on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange have
	sprung back from lows reached when the dollar dipped below the
	two guilder mark in January. But market analysts say only lower
	interest rates or a further rise in the dollar, now trading at
	around 2.09 guilders, could keep the momentum going.
	    "Between end-1982 and end-1986 Dutch stocks rose by around
	150 pct, but the dollar's sharp fall last year put the brake on
	the bull market," said Philip Menco, analyst with bank CLN Oyens
	en van Eeghen.
	    The dollar's current level compares with an average in 1986
	of 2.45 guilders, and 3.35 in 1985, official figures show.
	    But Arjen Los, analyst with Dutch merchant bank Pierson,
	Heldring en Pierson, sees room for some optimism,
	   "The market is exaggerating the whole dollar affair. We've
	seen the bottom of its decline. But what is lacking is a
	stimulus on the interest rate front," he said.
	    Analysts said they expected little impact from provincial
	elections on Wednesday as the government's position was secure.
	    "The scope for price rises in Dutch shares is narrow, given
	the limited room for lower interest rates," said Los, adding the
	Dutch market can currently only dream of returns of around 15
	pct seen in rising markets elsewhere in Europe.
	    "When the dollar slumped in the second half of 1986, U.S.
	And U.K investors were heavy sellers of Dutch stock. They made
	an enormous currency gain," Menco said.
	    Finance Ministry figures show foreign investment in Dutch
	stock last year fell by nearly half to 4.2 billion guilders.
	    Los envisaged no significant revival of foreign interest in
	the Dutch market. He saw the large, liquid Dutch pension funds
	pursuing a more aggressive portfolio management policy while
	continuing to invest in markets with weaker currencies.
	    Outflows of non-bank Dutch capital totalled a record 21.4
	billion guilders last year, 12.3 billion of which stemmed from
	securities transactions.
	    "Dutch institutions have been rallying to buoyant foreign
	markets, but this season's results could coax some of them back
	to the relatively underpriced Dutch market," Koos Ten Have of
	Staal Bankiers said.
	    Ten Have said Dutch price/earnings ratios based on
	forecasts of 1987 results were broadly unchanged compared with
	1986. With an average ratio of 10, they were still attractively
	lower than shares of other exchanges, he added.
	    He said the reliability of the strong guilder was a further
	factor favouring Dutch stock investments.
	    Senior bank economists said this week's official economic
	forecast by the CPB planning agency painted a gloomy picture of
	the Dutch economy but this would not shake investor confidence
	in the Dutch business sector. The Dutch economy was doing
	relatively well compared with other nations, they added.
	    Analysts say most companies have fulfilled expectations,
	while some firms, particularly in food and publishing,
	surprised the market with continued solid profit growth despite
	major dollar and sterling investments.
	    Unexpectedly positive results from companies like Unilever
	Plc-NV <UN.AS>, NV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken <PGLO.AS> and
	Heineken NV <HEIN.AS> were balanced by poor performances by the
	three banks, which achieved higher profits partly by reducing
	their risk provisions. Analysts still have doubts about the
	insurance sector, and many companies stressed the negative
	impact of lower currencies on their guilder earnings in 1986.
	    Food and publishing are seen as major growth areas, despite
	the fact many of these companies have significant activities in
	the U.K and U.S.
	    Food chain Ahold NV <AHLN.AS> reported an 8.1 pct increase
	in net 1986 profit but said it did not see profits growing in
	1987 due to the uncertainty of the dollar.
	    Turnover declined by 5.7 pct to 11.4 billion guilders.
	About 1.5 billion guilders of this decline was due to the lower
	dollar and one third of turnover volume was achieved in the
	U.S.
	    "Ahold is too cautious over the dollar," Los said. "As long as
	such companies continue to maintain their U.S. Activities and
	fund their expansion there, the negative influence is purely an
	accounting effect."
	    Koninklijke Wessanen NV <WESS.AS> and Heineken also managed
	handsome profit increases of 16.6 and 7.5 pct respectively,
	while blaming disappointing turnover in their substantial
	overseas activities on the lower dollar.
	    Initial publishing results indicate a bumper year for
	shares in this sector and ensure firm interest despite higher
	price/earnings ratios, ranging from 12 to 14. REUTER

	Government and monetary authorities today
	staged a concerted effort to calm spreading panic on Japanese
	stock exchanges but market analysts said there were limits to
	their ability to succeed.
	    "The ability of the Big Four (Japanese securities houses)
	and the Finance Ministry is limited," said Barclays de Zoete
	Wedd economist Peter Morgan.
	    Finance Ministry officials asked the big four securities
	companies this afternoon to help calm panic selling on the
	Tokyo Stock Exchange, ministry officials said.
	    Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone was quoted by Kyodo News
	Service as saying he was watching the stock market situation.
	    But he rejected comparisons with the 1929 stock market
	collapse and subsequent recession.
	    Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the Tokyo stock
	market should not be gravely affected by downturns in New York
	and London because there are clear signs of a Japanese economic
	recovery and exchange rate stability.
	    Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita also tried to calm
	the panic, saying in a statement that world stock markets were
	excessively concerned about the economic future.
	    Traditionally, the four big houses  -- Nomura Securities Co
	Ltd, Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd, Daiwa Securities Co Ltd, and
	Nikko Securities Co Ltd -- have influenced the market because
	of their sheer size and overwhelming market share.
	    This strength has in the past made it possible for the
	brokerages to calm down markets under guidance from the Finance
	Ministry, analysts said.
	    But the analysts questioned whether the brokerages, which
	have already suffered heavy losses from falling bond markets
	over the past year, would have the strength this time to turn
	things around.
	    "The question is, are the Japanese brokerages strong enough
	to force investors to buy," said Johsen Takahashi, research
	director at the Mitsubishi Research Institute.
	    "If we consider that they have suffered serious losses in
	the bond markets and in their U.S. Investments, it is debatable
	whether they they could support buying," he said.
	    "We can support things to some extent, but we can't
	completely suppress selling," said one Japanese broker.
	    Some analysts said the high percentage of shares cross-held
	by financial institutions and other corporations could have a
	stabilising effect on the market.
	    Some 80 pct of shares are held by corporate shareholders,
	said Keikichi Honda, general manager of the Bank of Tokyo Ltd's
	economic research division. "This is a tightly woven textile. In
	its own way it is stronger than Wall Street."
	    But other analysts expressed doubt about this argument.
	    "If a high percent of shares is cross held, everything
	happens at the edges and the relative moves can be larger," said
	Kleinwort Benson Ltd financial analyst Simon Smithson. "Selling
	will drive prices down an enormous distance because of no
	liquidity."
	    "You don't need big volume to get big declines in the market
	-- you just need a huge imbalance between sellers and buyers,"
	said Barclay's Morgan.
	    Shares held by what are termed "stable shareholders," or
	banks and other companies with which a firm does business,
	might also find their way onto the market if the outlook gets
	bad enough, some analsyst said.
	    "Closely held shares could become unclosely held," said
	Morgan. But he said such a prospect is unlikely right now
	because companies, with their improved earnings prospects, do
	not need to sell shares for cash flow reasons.
