	Central bank governor Chang Chi-cheng
	rejected a request by textile makers to halt the rise of the
	Taiwan dollar against the U.S. Dollar to stop them losing
	orders to South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore, a spokesman for
	the Taiwan Textile Federation said.
	    He quoted Chang as telling representatives of 19 textile
	associations last Saturday the government could not fix the
	Taiwan dollar exchange rate at 35 to one U.S. Dollar due to
	U.S. Pressure for an appreciation of the local currency.
	    The Federation asked the government on February 19 to hold
	the exchange rate at that level.
	    The federation said in its request that many local textile
	exporters were operating without profit and would go out of
	business if the rate continued to fall.
	    It said the Taiwan dollar has risen almost 14 pct against
	the U.S. Dollar since September 1985 while the South Korean won
	climbed only four pct. The Singapore and Hong Kong dollars
	remained stable against the U.S. Unit in that period, it said.
	    Many local bankers and economists predict Taiwan's dollar
	will rise to between 32 and 33 per U.S. Dollar by year-end.
	    Chang was quoted as saying this would depend on Taiwan's
	ability to reduce its trade surplus with the U.S. This year.
	    The surplus widened to a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs in
	calendar 1986 from 10.2 billion in 1985, official figures show.
	    Taiwan's textile exports fell by almost four pct in January
	to 562 mln U.S. Dlrs from 583 mln in January 1986, the same
	figures show.
	    Textiles are Taiwan's second-largest export earner, after
	electrical and electronic products.
	    Textile exports surged to 7.8 billion U.S. Dlrs last year
	from 6.2 billion in 1985. Exports to the U.S. Last year were
	worth 2.8 billion U.S. Dlrs.

	A Taiwan mission will leave next week for

	Trade official said.
	    Under the agreement signed last July, Taiwan's textile
	export growth was limited to 0.5 pct each year until 1988,
	based on the value of 1985 exports.
	    The official said the pact was unfair because the United

CONTENT:
	Taiwan and the U.S. Have revised and
	extended their textile export agreement after negotiations in
	Washington this week, a spokesman for the Taiwan Textile
	Federation said.
	    Charles Chen told Reuters the original three year accord
	has been extended by one year to the end of 1989. The U.S. Has
	agreed to raise the limit on annual growth of Taiwan's textile
	and apparel exports to one pct from 0.5 pct for calendar 1989,
	he said. "The new accord is more fair and gives breathing space
	to our textile makers (so they can) diversify their exports to
	other nations," he added.
	    Chen said the revised agreement puts Taiwan on similar
	textile exporting terms to Hong Kong and South Korea. But
	despite the changes, Taiwanese firms have lost orders to rivals
	in Hong Kong and South Korea because of the strong Taiwan
	dollar, he said. The Taiwan currency has risen 17 pct against
	the U.S. Dollar since September 1985 while the Korean won rose
	by some six pct and the Hong Kong dollar was stable.
	    Taiwan's textile exports to the U.S. Amounted to 2.8
	billion U.S. Dlrs last year out of total exports to the U.S. Of
	7.8 billion. Textile exports are expected to remain the same

	TRADE INTERESTS READY FOR BATTLE IN U.S. HOUSE

CONTENT:
	U.S. lawmakers are gearing up for a
	showdown between protectionists and free traders as a major
	trade bill winds its way through committees to a vote by the
	full House of Representatives in late April.
	    In a move to toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws, a key
	House subcommittee last week approved a toned-down version of
	legislation to require President Reagan to retaliate against
	foreign countries that follow unfair trade practices.
	    The bill will be the cornerstone of congressional efforts
	to restore competitiveness of American industries and turn
	around last year's record 169 billion dlrs trade deficit.
	    Generally, the bill's provisions toughen U.S. enforcement
	of trade laws.
	    The trade bill forces the administration to act rapidly on
	complaints of unfair trade practices, such as dumping products
	in the United States at prices below cost of production. It
	also forces the administration to act rapidly when an industry
	complains that a surge in imports threatens its existence.
	    In writing the bill, the subcommittee rejected calls for
	trade relief for specific industries such as textiles.
	    Several lawmakers have argued the new trade bill made too
	many concessions to Reagan and said they intend to back
	amendments to "get tough" with countries that violate trade
	agreements or keep out U.S. products.
	    But congressmen known for their allegiance to free trade
	said the bill ties Reagan's hands too much in trade disputes
	and they will seek to restore his negotiating powers.
	    Bill Frenzel, R-MI., said the subcommittee's bill was not
	one "that a free trader like me could endorse in all respects,"
	but he emphasized there was a consensus among lawmakers to work
	toward a bill Reagan and Republicans would ultimately endorse.
	    The goal of trade legislation was "to make our trade policy
	stronger without violating our international trade agreements,"
	he said.
	    In a key concession made at the urging of Ways and Means
	Committee chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-IL., the trade
	subcommittee backed off a requirement that would have forced
	Reagan to impose automatically quotas or tariffs on imports
	from countries that engage in unfair trade practices.
	    It also agreed the president may waive any retaliation if
	it would hurt the U.S. economy.
	    Rostenkowski insisted the more moderate approach was
	necessary if the House wanted to pass a bill Reagan would sign
	into law.
	    Reagan last year blocked Senate consideration of a tough
	House trade bill he branded as protectionist and this year he
	only reluctantly agreed to support a trade bill when he saw
	Democratic leaders were determined to pass such legislation.
	    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters late
	last week that the administration still did not like some of
	the bill's provisions, but he added, "Generally we feel very
	good about the bipartisan consideration of the trade
	legislation. I think we are progressing very well."
	    The first battle will take place next week when the full
	House Ways and Means Committee considers an amendment by Rep.
	Richard Gephardt, D-MO., to force countries like Japan, South
	Korea and Taiwan to cut their trade surpluses with the U.S.
	    The subcommittee limited the Gephardt plan to provide only
	that the existence of a large trade surplus with the United
	States will trigger an investigation of unfair trade practices,
	but would not automatically set off retaliation.
	    Organized labor has pressed lawmakers for more relief from
	imports where jobs have been lost to foreign competition.
	    AFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland this year angered the
	administration when he said any trade bill Reagan would sign
	would not be worth passage in Congress.
	    But Rostenkowski set the tone of the trade debate by
	saying, "I'm not trying to write legislation to please Lane
	Kirkland. I'm trying to write legislation that will be signed
	by the president."
	    Rep. Ed Jenkins (D-GA.) intends to push separately a bill
	to protect the domestic textile and shoe industry, an aide
	said. Reagan vetoed a similar measure last year.
	    House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas, one of the most
	influential proponents of aid for specific industries beset by
	low-priced foreign competition, last week renewed his call for
	import relief for the domestic oil industry and announced his
	support for a Senate plan to trigger a temporary oil import
	tariff when imports reach half of domestic consumption.

	ASIAN EXPORTERS FEAR DAMAGE FROM U.S.-JAPAN RIFT
TOPICS:

CONTENT:
	Mounting trade friction between the
	U.S. And Japan has raised fears among many of Asia's exporting
	nations that the row could inflict far-reaching economic
	damage, businessmen and officials said.
	    They told Reuter correspondents in Asian capitals a U.S.
	Move against Japan might boost protectionist sentiment in the
	U.S. And lead to curbs on American imports of their products.
	    But some exporters said that while the conflict would hurt
	them in the long-run, in the short-term Tokyo's loss might be
	their gain.
	    The U.S. Has said it will impose 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on
	imports of Japanese electronics goods on April 17, in
	retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to stick to a pact not
	to sell semiconductors on world markets at below cost.
	    Unofficial Japanese estimates put the impact of the tariffs
	at 10 billion dlrs and spokesmen for major electronics firms
	said they would virtually halt exports of products hit by the
	new taxes.
	    "We wouldn't be able to do business," said a spokesman for
	leading Japanese electronics firm Matsushita Electric
	Industrial Co Ltd <MC.T>.
	    "If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time
	beyond a few months it will mean the complete erosion of
	exports (of goods subject to tariffs) to the U.S.," said Tom
	Murtha, a stock analyst at the Tokyo office of broker <James
	Capel and Co>.
	    In Taiwan, businessmen and officials are also worried.
	    "We are aware of the seriousness of the U.S. Threat against
	Japan because it serves as a warning to us," said a senior
	Taiwanese trade official who asked not to be named.
	    Taiwan had a trade trade surplus of 15.6 billion dlrs last
	year, 95 pct of it with the U.S.
	    The surplus helped swell Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves
	to 53 billion dlrs, among the world's largest.
	    "We must quickly open our markets, remove trade barriers and
	cut import tariffs to allow imports of U.S. Products, if we
	want to defuse problems from possible U.S. Retaliation," said
	Paul Sheen, chairman of textile exporters <Taiwan Safe Group>.
	    A senior official of South Korea's trade promotion
	association said the trade dispute between the U.S. And Japan
	might also lead to pressure on South Korea, whose chief exports
	are similar to those of Japan.
	    Last year South Korea had a trade surplus of 7.1 billion
	dlrs with the U.S., Up from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985.
	    In Malaysia, trade officers and businessmen said tough
	curbs against Japan might allow hard-hit producers of
	semiconductors in third countries to expand their sales to the
	U.S.
	    In Hong Kong, where newspapers have alleged Japan has been
	selling below-cost semiconductors, some electronics
	manufacturers share that view. But other businessmen said such
	a short-term commercial advantage would be outweighed by
	further U.S. Pressure to block imports.
	    "That is a very short-term view," said Lawrence Mills,
	director-general of the Federation of Hong Kong Industry.
	    "If the whole purpose is to prevent imports, one day it will
	be extended to other sources. Much more serious for Hong Kong
	is the disadvantage of action restraining trade," he said.
	    The U.S. Last year was Hong Kong's biggest export market,
	accounting for over 30 pct of domestically produced exports.
	    The Australian government is awaiting the outcome of trade
	talks between the U.S. And Japan with interest and concern,
	Industry Minister John Button said in Canberra last Friday.
	    "This kind of deterioration in trade relations between two
	countries which are major trading partners of ours is a very
	serious matter," Button said.
	    He said Australia's concerns centred on coal and beef,
	Australia's two largest exports to Japan and also significant
	U.S. Exports to that country.
	    Meanwhile U.S.-Japanese diplomatic manoeuvres to solve the
	trade stand-off continue.
	    Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party yesterday outlined
	a package of economic measures to boost the Japanese economy.
	    The measures proposed include a large supplementary budget
	and record public works spending in the first half of the
	financial year.
	    They also call for stepped-up spending as an emergency
	measure to stimulate the economy despite Prime Minister
	Yasuhiro Nakasone's avowed fiscal reform program.
	    Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Michael Smith and Makoto
	Kuroda, Japan's deputy minister of International Trade and
	Industry (MITI), are due to meet in Washington this week in an
	effort to end the dispute.

	The European Community has told
	Congress that if textile legislation injuring EC interests is
	approved, there was no doubt the community would retaliate
	against U.S. exports.
	    Roy Denmam, head of the EC delegation here, issued the
	warning in a letter to Senator Lloyd Bentsen, chairman of the
	Finance Committee. A copy of the letter was provided Reuters.
	    Denmam told Bentsen, a Texas Democrat, that if the textile
	legislation passed on its own or was included in an omnibus
	trade bill and injured EC interests, "there should be no doubt
	that the EC will retaliate against the United States."
	    He added that "at a time when U.S. textile exports to the EC
	are growing rapidly, one result of such retaliation would be a
	substantial reduction of U.S. exports and jobs."
	    The textile legislation, backed strongly by the industry,
	hard hit by imports, and by senators from textile-producing
	states would impose new tough global quotas on textile imports
	and for the first time include Europe in the quotas.
	    Reagan Administration officials have also opposed the
	textile legislation, saying that if it passed it would likely
	prompt a presidential veto.
	    Denman made his comments on the textile issue in a general
	assessment of the Senate trade bill, titled S.490.
	    He said he was concerned about provisions in the Senate
	bill that would limit, if not eliminate, the president's
	discretion if retaliating against nations for keeping their
	home markets closed to foreign goods.
	    U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter has also opposed
	those provisions, arguing that presidential flexibility was
	needed in order to be able to negotiate with countries to open
	their markets, with retaliation being retained as a final, but
	discretionary, weapon.
	    The pending overall trade legislation would force the
	Administration to consult often with Congress and seek its
	approval during step-by-step GATT negotiations.
	    He said "enactment of S. 490 would reduce the confidence of
	other governments in America's commitment to multinational
	trade."
	    Summing up the senate legislation, Denman said "a number of
	provisions of that bil may achieve the opposite of what is
	intended and lead to dangerous consequences for the world and
	the U.S. economy."

	TAIWAN PLANS NEW TARIFF CUTS
TOPICS:

CONTENT:
	Taiwan plans another round of deep tariff
	cuts this year to help narrow its trade surplus with the U.S.,
	A senior economic planner said.
	    Wang Chao-Ming, vice-chairman of the council for economic
	planning and development, told Reuters Taiwan would further
	reduce import tariffs on 1,700 products sometime in the second
	half of this year.
	    Cuts of up to 50 pct on those items were made last year and
	Wang said further cuts would go much deeper.
	    "We have to speed up liberalisation and cut import tariffs
	faster and more substantially," he said.
	    The United States, Taiwan's main trading partner, has said
	the island's import tariffs, still ranging from a high of
	almost 60 pct, were unacceptable. It has criticised the cuts as
	too selective.
	     Taiwan's trade surplus with the United States hit 13.6
	billion dlrs last year. The surplus has boosted foreign
	exchange reserves to 50 billion dlrs, which Wang said made
	Taiwan a target for U.S. Protectionism.
	    Wang said the trade surplus and the reserves weakened
	Taiwan's position in talks with Washington over export quotas,
	particularly for shoes, textiles and machine tools which are
	among the island's main export-earners.
	    A special Taiwanese trade delegation leaves for Washington
	tomorrow to try to renegotiate an agreement signed last year
	limiting exports of Taiwan textiles.
	    Under the accord, Taiwan's textile export growth was
	limited to 0.5 pct each year until 1988. Taipei has said it is
	losing markets to South Korea and Hong Kong which were given
	more generous terms.

	LATIN, CARIBBEAN NATIONS OPPOSE TRADE BILLS
TOPICS:
	trade

	usa, japan, taiwan, south-korea, mexico, venezuela, brazil
CONTENT:
	A group of Latin American and
	Caribbean nations formally opposed trade legislation pending in
	Congress, saying it would curb their exports, slow development
	and hinder its ability to repay foreign debt.
	    Mario Rodriguez Montero, president of an Organization of
	American States special committee on trade, said he was aware
	of the large U.S. trade deficit, but added "the region should
	not be the one affected by the trade bills."
	    He said the causes of the deficit were the strong dollar
	and the budget deficit, and "it is regrettable to solve it by a
	trade bill that would only serve private U.S. interests."
	    Rodriguez made the comment at a news conference after two
	days of meetings with U.S. officials on trade bills now in
	Congress that are designed to reduce the U.S. trade deficit,
	which last year hit a record 166.3 billion dlrs.
	    Congressional observers say the bills are aimed mainly at
	Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and a few other nations with large,
	annual trade surpluses with the United States.
	    Mexico, Brazil and Venezuela are the only Latin nations
	with large trade surpluses last year with the United States,
	but even Mexico, with the largest, had a surplus of only 5.2
	billion dlrs, against Japan's of 58.6 billion dlrs.
	    The European Community has also opposed the bills.
	    Rodriguez said the Latin and Caribbean nations backed the
	Reagan Administration's opposition to many of the sections in
	the legislation, including those to curb imports and to require
	retaliation for foreign unfair trade practices.
	    He told reporters the committee would likely mount a
	campaign to fight the legislation when it comes up for debate
	on the Senate floor, expected next week.
	    Rodriguez said "the region needs trade to continue
	development.  We hope this need will not be affected negatively
	by trade legislation."
	    Rodriguez said: "we need to keep the market opens -
	especially the U.S. market - to obtain the necessary foreign
	exchange not only to service the debt but also to continue
	national development progress."
	    President Reagan has said he would veto any legislation he
	termed "protectionist," and his aides now are mounting a effort
	to water down some of the objectionable provisions in the
	legislation.
	    Asked whether Reagan was ready to cast a veto, Rodriguez
	said as yet "the administration is not in a veto frame of mind."
