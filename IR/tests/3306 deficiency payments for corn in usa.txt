	U.S. CORN, SORGHUM PAYMENTS 50-50 CASH/CERTS

CONTENT:
	Eligible producers of 1986 crop U.S.
	corn and sorghum will receive an estimated 600 mln dlrs in
	deficiency payments -- 50 pct in generic commodity certificates
	and 50 pct in cash, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
	    It said corn producers will receive about 515 mln dlrs and
	sorghum producers about 85 mln dlrs.
	    Only the cash portion of the payments will be subject to
	the 4.3 pct reduction in compliance with the Gramm-Rudman
	budget deficit control act of 1985, it said.
	    Corn and sorghum producers who requested advance deficiency
	payments have already received about 2.8 billion dlrs and 225
	mln dlrs, respectively, USDA said.
	    The Department said deficiency payment rates of 51.5 cents
	per bushel for corn and 49 cents per bushel for sorghum were
	received by producers requesting advance payments.
	    Deficiency payments are calculated as the difference
	between an established target price and the higher of the basic
	loan rate, or the national average price received by farmers
	during the first five months of the marketing year --
	September-January.
	    National weighted average market prices for the first five
	months of the season were 1.46 dlrs per bushel for corn and
	1.33 dlrs per bushel for sorghum. Eligible corn producers will
	be paid 63 cts per bushel, based on the difference between the
	3.03 target price and the 2.40 dlr per bushel basic loan rate.
	    Sorghum producers' deficiency payment rate will be 60 cents
	per bushel, based on the difference between the 2.88 dlrs per
	bushel target price and the 2.28 dlrs per bushel basic loan
	rate.
	    The deficiency payment rates for both commodities are the
	maximum permitted by law, the department said.
	    Eligible corn and sorghum producers will receive another
	1986 crop deficiency payment in October if the national average
	market prices received by farmers during the entire marketing
	year for both commodities are below the basic loan rates, the
	department said.
	    The payments will be issued through local Agricultural
	Stabilization and Conservation Service offices, it said.

	FINAL 50/50 CORN CERTS SEEN AT 1.6 BILLION DLRS
TOPICS:

CONTENT:
	The Agriculture Department will have
	to release an estimated 1.6 billion dlrs worth of in-kind
	certificates, or certs, to corn farmers this fall if USDA
	decides to maintain an equal split of total 1986 feedgrain
	deficiency payments in cash and certs, USDA officials said.
	    Final 1986 crop deficiency payments will be available to
	feed grain producers in October. Wheat deficiency payments for
	the 1986 crop, now complete, were made in a 50/50
	cash-certificate split, and USDA officials have indicated they
	want to do the same for feedgrains.
	    Over 3.2 billion dlrs of an estimated 6.0 billion in corn
	deficiency payments have already been announced, with 1.42
	billion dlrs (43 pct) set in certificates. The final payment
	must be 1.6 billion dlrs in certs (57 pct) for a 50/50 split.
	    However, the release this month of almost 600 mln dlrs of
	deficiency payments was equally divided in cash and certs,
	doing nothing to bring up the percentage of certs.
	    Some USDA analysts said the payments reflected hesitation
	from the Office of Managament and Budget to allow another huge
	release of certs onto the market.
	    Bills are pending in Congress to move up the final
	feedgrain deficiency payment to "as soon as five months after
	harvest as possible," rather than the current year lag time.
	    Neither Rep. Edward Madigan (R-Ill.) nor Sen. Bob Dole
	(R-Kans.), sponsors of the bills, have brought the legislation
	forward. Aides said timing will depend on budget discussions.

	of this payment will be in cash, von Garlem said, but he said

CONTENT:
	Senators are considering offering a
	host of amendments to a farm disaster assistance bill which
	could come up soon on the Senate floor, staff members said.
	    The bill, already passed by the House, would enable 1987
	winter wheat and feedgrains farmers hit by Midwestern flooding
	last year to receive at least 92 pct of their federal income
	support payments even if they did not plant.
	    Amendments considered by Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.)
	would apply the so-called "0/92" option to all 1987 program crops
	or, if that failed, to spring wheat, Senate staff said.
	    Sens. Robert Dole (R-Kan.) and Charles Grassley (R-Iowa)
	were considering an amendment that would allow feedgrains
	producers to receive final deficiency payments in March instead
	of in October.
	    Earlier this year Dole said advancing the final deficiency
	payments would provide feedgrains producers with approximately
	three billion dlrs in income payments prior to spring planting
	instead of in the fall.
	    Dole and Grassley are also considering an amendment that
	would offer a two dlr per bushel bonus payment to corn farmers
	for any erodible cropland they enrolled in the conservation
	reserve program last year.
	    The bonus payment has been offered to farmers signing up
	for the corn program this spring. The U.S. Agriculture
	Department has indicated it would oppose broadening the corn
	bonus offer.
	    Sen. Larry Pressler (R-S.D.) was said to be contemplating
	an amendment that would offer the 0/92 option to spring wheat
	producers who were prevented from planting this spring because
	of flooding last year.
	    Sen. David Boren (D-Okla.) was eyeing a measure that would

	HOUSE 0/92 FARM PROPOSAL SEEN SPARKING DEBATE
TOPICS:
	grain, wheat
PLACES:
	usa
CONTENT:
	A House Agriculture Committee meeting
	later today to draft a disaster aid bill is expected to spark a
	debate between lawmakers who want to expand the 0/92, or
	"de-coupling," provision to cover feedgrains, and those who
	oppose 0/92 or want it severely limited, Congressional sources
	said.
	    The disaster aid bill as it now stands calls for a one-year
	0/92 pilot program for 1987 crop wheat and the 1988 winter
	wheat crop. The bill would allow farmers to forego planting and
	still receive 92 pct of deficiency payments.
	    The administration has strongly urged that the bill be
	expanded to feedgrains and to more than one year.
	    It is difficult to tell in what form the 0/92 provision
	will emerge from the committee, the sources said.
	    Proponents of an expansion of 0/92 maintain there are large
	estimated cost savings of such a bill -- ranging from estimates
	by the administration of 200 to 500 mln dlrs.
	    Opposition to a reopening of the 1985 farm bill at this
	time is the major reason cited by those against an expansion of
	the bill, committee staffers said.
	    The 0/92 plan is scheduled to be discussed at 1530 EST. A
	conflicting floor vote delayed the start of the meeting, and
	staffers said it may have to be delayed even until next week.
	    Such a delay would not bode well for proponents of an
	expanded 0/92 program, since spring planting in many areas of
	the country will be underway in the next few weeks and signup
	for the 1987 wheat and feedgrains program ends March 30.
	    Farmers are now making their planting decisions, so
	something has to be done quickly if a 0/92 program is to be
	implemented, an Agriculture Department source said.
	    An expansion of 0/92 to feedgrains was opposed in last
	week's subcommittee hearing on the bill, with subcommittee
	chairman Dan Glickman, D-Kan., saying that more study of the
	consequences of decoupling on feedgrains plantings was
	necessary.
	    Major commodity groups, including the National Corn
	Growers, the American Farm Bureau and the National Cattlemen's
	Association, have voiced strong opposition to 0/92.
	    But proponents of an expanded 0/92 argue that the bill
	currently is not equitable for all grains producers, so it
	should be extended to other crops.
	    There will be difficulty in limiting 0/92 to wheat, said
	Gene Moos, aide to house majority leader Tom Foley, D-Wash.
	    Projected cost savings, in the current atmosphere of try to
	decrease farm expenditures, would also be hard to ignore in the
	debate to expand the 0/92 application, Moos said.
	    Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Tex., may be planning to introduce
	a bill to restrict 0/92 to only 1987 crop wheat, with the
	argument that now is not the time to vote in favor of any major
	changes in the farm bill.
	    "Stenholm's bill is not a rejection of 0/92, only of the
	timing," a congressional staff member said.
	    Rep. Arland Stangeland (R-Minn.) is reported to have an
	amendment to expand the 0/92 provision to 1987 and 1988
	feedgrains.

	GLICKMAN PUSHES HARD FOR 0/92 FARM PLAN
TOPICS:
	grain, wheat, corn, oilseed, soybean
PLACES:
	usa
CONTENT:
	Implementation of a one-year 0/92
	pilot program for wheat and feedgrains was strongly promoted
	today by the chairman of a key house agriculture subcommittee
	as a way to cut farm costs and simultaneously give farmers
	another option when making their planting decisions.
	    "We have a budget driven farm policy. It may be a shame,
	but we are locked into this," said Dan Glickman, (D-Kans.),
	chairman of the subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feed
	grains. "We need to look at ways to cut costs and not hurt the
	farmer. A 0/92 plan, if properly done, could do both."
	    Glickman announced this week plans to introduce a 0/92 bill
	for 1987 and 1988 wheat and feedgrains. An aide to Glickman
	said that it will probably be introduced next week.
	    Glickman said a 0/92 program, which allows a farmer to
	forego planting and still receive 92 pct of his deficiency
	payment, would not be a major revision of the 1985 farm bill --
	only an extension of the 50/92 option already provided under
	the current bill.
	    It is premature to make any major changes in the farm bill,
	he said, but if agriculture has to make further cuts to meet
	budget goals, a voluntary 0/92 plan would be better than
	sharply cutting target prices, as USDA has proposed.
	    A 0/92 plan, however, would not be decoupling, but simply a
	different type of acreage diversion program, Glickman said.
	    Decoupling -- delinking planting decisions from government
	payments -- is too much of a policy change to approve at this
	point, he said.
	    "I don't think there is any interest in pursuing a
	decoupling bill this year. Period. Unequivocal," Glickman said
	at the hearing.
	    Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.), cosponsor of the
	Boren/Boschwitz decoupling plan, said he supports a short term
	0/92 program as a move to a more permament decoupling plan.
	    Boschwitz plans to introduce a 0/92 plan in the senate. His
	plan would guarantee a certain deficiency payment to
	participating farmers, require that idled acreage be put to
	conservation use only, prohibit haying and grazing on extra
	idled acreage, limit participation to a certain number of acres
	in a county and provide tenant protection provisions.
	    "I know we cannot obtain complete decoupling in 1987, but
	we can at least move in that direction," Boschwitz said.
	    Robbin Johnson, vice president of Cargill, Inc., testified
	in favor of decoupling. Decoupling would end the current bias
	in U.S. farm policy towards overproduction and reduce farmers'
	dependency on the government, he said.
	    A 0/92 plan does not go far enough in decoupling, Johnson
	said, and would still encourage farmers to plant.
	    Officials from the National Corn Growers Association and
	the National Cattlemen's Association said their groups oppose
	any 0/92 or decoupling plan due to concerns about reopening the
	farm bill and creating more confusion among farmers.
	    But when asked if his association were forced to choose
	between a ten pct cut in target prices or a 0/92 program, Larry
	Johnson of the Corn Growers said they would agree to 0/92
	rather than take sharp cuts in target levels.

	AROUND 3.5 MLN ACRES SAID TO BE IDLED BY 0/92
TOPICS:
	grain, wheat, corn, cotton, sorghum, barley, corn
PLACES:
	usa
CONTENT:
	A 0/92 program would have very
	little impact on U.S. acreage, prompting farmers to idle only
	an additional 3.5 mln acres of cropland every year, according
	to a report from the Agriculture Department.
	    The savings resulting from the additional 3.5 mln acres
	idled would be a little over 400 mln dlrs in loan savings, 35
	mln dlrs in transportation and storage savings, and 10-20 mln
	dlrs per year in deficiency payment savings, the report said.
	    The USDA report asssessed the impacts of the proposed 0/92
	acreage program for wheat, corn, cotton, sorghum and barley.
	Last year, almost 245 mln acres of those crops were harvested.
	    "The likelihood that the 0-92 provisiion will cause very
	large acreages to be removed from crop production is quite
	small," the report said.
	    "The returns on typical farms still favor participation in
	the usual acreage reduction programs and seeding the permitted
	acreage," the USDA report said.
	    The 0/92 program, which would allow farmers to forego
	planting and still receive 92 pct of their deficiency payment,
	would be most used by producers in high production/high risk
	areas where cost of production is high, said Keith Collins,
	director of USDA's economics analysis staff.
	    "In the heart of the corn belt, you would not get that much
	participation," Collins said.
	    USDA estimated that an additional one mln acres of wheat
	would be ildled under 0/92, 1.5 mln acres of corn, 500,000
	acres of sorghum and barley and 500,000 acres of cotton.
	    Production from these idled acres would be equivalent to 40
	mln bushels of wheat, 180 mln bushels of corn, 20 mln bushels
	of sorghum, 10 mln bushels of barley, and 500,000 bales of
	cotton, the report said.
	    "In determining whether to participate, a producer would
	need to weigh the expected cash costs of production against the
	loan rate ... The risk that market prices may rise above the
	expected levels and reduce the deficiency payment also must be
	considered," according to the analysis.
	    "What you're giving up under 0/92 is the difference between
	the loan rate and the cost of production," Collins said.
	    For producers with low production costs, that difference is
	greater and can be applied to paying variable costs, he said.
	Under these cicumstances, farmers would not want to go along
	with 0/92. But for high cost producers, 0/92 would be more
	attractive.
	    Also, as loan rates get lower, Collins said there would be
	more incentives to participate in a 0/92 program.
	    "I would admit that its impacts would be very marginal at
	first, but it is a step towards the goal of separating
	production decisions from government payments," Collins said.
	    In a speech earlier today before the National Grains and
	Feed Association, USDA Secretary Richard Lyng said it is too
	late to implement 0/92 for 1987 crops since program signup will
	be over by the end of this month.

	Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., said he
	intended to offer legislation that would allow 1987 producers

	planted.
	    Boschwitz told the Senate Agriculture Committee that

	Agriculture Committee is approved by that body.
	    Boschwitz told Reuters that neither he nor the U.S.

	    Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.,

	A proposal by two U.S. House
	Democrats to target government farm benefits to small- and
	medium-sized farms was warmly received by Democrats on a
	House subcommittee today.
	    "On balance, this is the best new idea I have seen," said
	Rep. Dan Glickman (D-Kan.), Chairman of the House Agriculture
	Subcommittee on Wheat, Feedgrains and Soybeans. "This is the
	first hard constructive proposal coming out as an alternative
	to the (Reagan) administration's farm proposal."
	    The plan, offered by Reps. Tim Penny (D-Minn.) and Byron
	Dorgan (D-ND), would raise target prices for wheat to 5.00 dlrs
	per bushel and for corn to 3.50 dlrs. Producers could receive
	deficiency payments on up to 80 pct of normal yield but not
	more than on 30,000 bu of corn and 20,000 bu of wheat.
	    The proposal also would require acreage reductions of 20
	pct, eliminate generic certificates and prohibit persons not
	actively engaged in farming from receiving program benefits.
	    Dorgan said the bill would save 24 billion dlrs over five
	years, protect family farms and eliminate government
	accumulation of stocks because nonrecourse loans would be
	halted.
	    However, Rep. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) said the measure would
	"involve the federal government in deciding and defining who a
	family farmer is."
	    Roberts said the bill, for example, would restrict program
	payments to 500 acres of wheat production in western Kansas.
	    Other Republicans on the panel questioned how the bill
	would determine if a person was actively engaged in farming and
	therefore eligible for payments.

	U.S. House and Senate budget
	negotiators agreed as part of an overall budget accord reached
	yesterday, to cut 1.25 billion dlrs from fiscal 1988 spending
	on agricultural programs, Congressional sources told Reuters.
	    The agreed cut in farm programs is a compromise between 1.4
	billion sought by the Senate and one billion by the House.
	    The negotiators also agreed to cut 1.6 billion from the
	farm budget in fiscal 1989 and 2.45 billion in 1990, for a
	total of 5.3 billion in saving over three years, sources said.
	    The agreement presents the House and Senate Agriculture
	committees with difficult choices on how to make changes in
	agriculture programs that achieve the budget savings targets
	without jeopardizing popular support payments, senior
	Congressional aides told Reuters.
	    Some farm state lawmakers already are manuevering to find
	the budget savings.
	    Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., Chairman of the House grains
	subcommittee, has introduced a bill which would freeze wheat
	and corn loan rates for the 1988 crop at the current 2.28 dlrs
	and 1.92 dlrs respectively, saying it would save 500 mln dlrs.
	    House Agriculture Committee chairman Kika De la Garza has
	said the committee will consider the Glickman proposal.
	    But Congressional sources said the proposal is unlikely to
	be approved because of opposition from Republican lawmakers and
	a strong stance by Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who said
	freezing loan rates would send the wrong signal to other major
	grain export competitors and would not achieve the budget
	savings Glickman claims.
	    Another area where Glickman and other have said budget
	savings might be made is to increase acreage reduction program,
	ARP, levels for wheat and corn.
	    However, on this issue also Lyng has taken a strong stand
	within the Reagan administration, arguing that the 1988 crop
	wheat acreage reduction should be left at 27.5 pct and not 30
	pct as sought by the Office of Management and Budget, OMB. Most
	commodity lobbyists expect Lyng to prevail.
	    Congressional sources said the only way to achieve
	significant budget cuts through ARP increases would be to boost
	the 1988 corn ARP. But one informed Congressional source said
	singling-out corn for an ARP increase would would be seen as
	unfair to one commodity.
	    Congressional sources said the areas where Congress is most
	likely to eventually look for budget savings are some
	tightening of the payment limitation rules, and possible 
	adoption of a 0/92 program for the 1988 crops of major grains.
	    Those changes would achieve a portion of the 1.25 billion
	but not enough, they said.
	    Ultimately, Congressional sources said the agriculture
	committees may be forced to apply an across-the-board cut on
	all Commodity Credit Corp. payments to farmers, including price
	support loans and deficiency payments, similar to the
	Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget cut applied in fiscal 1986.
	    This idea has been suggested by the American Farm Bureau
	Federation, AFBF, as the fairest approach for all commodities.

	CBT TRADERS LOOK AHEAD TO SPRING PLANTINGS
TOPICS:
	grain, cotton, wheat, oat, oilseed, soybean
PLACES:

CONTENT:
	Chicago Board of trade grain traders and
	analysts voiced a lot of interest in how farmers planned to
	handle their upcoming spring plantings, prompting sales of new
	crop months of corn and oats and purchases in new crop soybeans
	in the futures markets.
	    Professionals in the grains trade think that farmers will
	be more willing to stick with corn acres than soybeans because
	corn is protected by the acreage reduction program. That gives
	deficiency payments to farmers if corn prices stay low.
	    Farmers can place soybeans under the loan program if they
	sign-up for reduced acreage, but they have no price guarantees.
	    With the price outlook for both commodities so dismal,
	traders believe farmers will want to stick with a sure thing
	rather than gamble on soybeans, even though the new crop
	soybean/corn ratio of 2.9/1 would make planting soybeans more
	attractive under normal circumstances.
	    An announcement late Friday that the USDA will lift the
	limited cross-compliance requirement for the 1987 oats crop,
	means farmers will be able plant an estimated two to three mln
	more oat acres this year than last without being penalized,
	traders said.
	    Here too, acres some farmers may have been thinking of
	shifting to soybeans will now be planted with oats, due to the
	more attractive deal from the government, they added.
	    Cotton prices are almost twice what they were just six
	months ago, which should prompt many farmers in the South to
	put soybean land back into cotton.
	    One of the reasons for the steady increase in soybean
	production in recent years has been a general shift of acres in
	traditional cotton producing regions of the South to soybeans,
	which are easier to grow, one commercial trader said.

	OECD FARM SUBSIDIES STUDY RESULTS DETAILED
TOPICS:
	grain, wheat, corn
PLACES:
	usa, japan
CONTENT:
	The results of a controversial study
	of farm subsidies conducted by the Paris-based Organisation for
	Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, show Japan has the
	highest agriculture subsidies in the world, and that dairy
	farmers benefit more than any other commodity producers from
	subsidies.
	    Results of the study, which has not been released by OECD
	because of objections from some countries, were provided to
	Reuters by officials of several countries on condition they not
	be identified.
	    The OECD study calculates the level of farm subsidies for
	the years 1979-81 using a new measure called the producer
	subsidy equivalent, PSE.
	    The study shows that on dairy products Japan's PSE, or the
	amount of aid to farmers expressed as a percentage, averaged
	83.3 pct over 1979-81, with the European Community at 68.8 pct
	and the United States 48.2 pct.
	    For wheat Japan's PSE averaged 95.8 pct, the EC 28.1 and
	the U.S. 17.2. Japan's rice PSE was 68.8 pct compared to the EC
	13.6 and the U.S. 5.4 pct, the OECD calculations show.
	    In coarse grains, Japan's subsidies reached 107.1 pct
	compared with 27.9 pct for the EC and 13.1 pct for the U.S.
	Japan's beef subsidy was 54.9 pct versus 52.7 pct for the EC
	and 9.5 pct for the U.S., OECD concluded.
	    For sugar, Japan's PSE was 48.4 pct versus 27.9 pct in the
	EC and 13.1 pct for the U.S., the study shows.
	    The OECD calculated farm subsidies for other industrial
	countries such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand but in most
	cases the results were much lower than for the U.S., EC and
	Japan, the sources said.
	    Subsidies in Argentina and Brazil, two major developing
	country producers of commodities, were not included in the OECD
	work.
	    Officials said they hope to persuade reluctant countries to
	release the study soon, perhaps coinciding with the OECD
	ministerial meeting in Paris during May.
	    Some officials hope the OECD results will be used as a 
	basis for negotiations during the Uruguay round of global trade
	talks now underway in Geneva.
	    British Agriculture Minister Michael Jopling during a visit
	to Washington this week endorsed the OECD work as a starting
	point for the Uruguay round negotiations on agriculture.
	    He said the PSE calculations provide a tool to negotiate
	down domestic farm support levels, which are a major cause of
	the present crisis in world agriculture.
	    However, the OECD study results are controversial because
	they highlight the levels of assistance to farmers, officials
	familiar with the study said.
	    The U.S. Agriculture Department's Economic Research Service
	recently published a study of farm subsidies in an attempt to
	verify the OECD results and update them to 1982-84.
	    In some cases the results were substantially different than
	the OECD's, in part because farm policies in both the U.S. and
	elsewhere had changed markedly by 1982-84 from the OECD base
	period of 1979-81, U.S. officials said.
	    For example, the USDA study found the United States
	subsidies to corn producers were higher in 1982-84, at 25 to 49
	pct, than in the EC, at zero to nine pct.
	    French Maize Producers Association president Marcel Cazale,
	citing the result of the USDA calculation for corn, told
	reporters last week that the United States subsidizes its
	farmers more than the EC.
	    However, the sources said EC corn subsidies are probably
	higher than the U.S. now because of increases since 1984.
	    Officials of several countries have been asked to
	contribute data to OECD so that the study can be updated to
	1985 subsidy levels, a much more relevant measure of the
	current world farm situation.
	    The updated calculations, which may take several months to
	complete, are expected to show substantial increases in U.S.
	subsidy levels for sugar because the U.S. imposed restrictive
	import quotas in 1982 as aid to the domestic industry.
	    U.S. subsidy levels also are increased by the 1985 farm
	bill, which sharply boosted government deficiency payments to
	grain farmers and applied a marketing loan for rice, officials
	added.
