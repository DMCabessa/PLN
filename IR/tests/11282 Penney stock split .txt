	J.C. Penney Co's stock rose sharply 
	after analyst William Smith of Smith Barney recommended the
	stock, based on the company's strong earnings momentum and the
	possibility of a stock buyback, dividend hike or stock split,
	traders said.
	    "I am very impressed with the strong basic earnings story,"
	analyst Smith said, noting that the company has "fine tuned its
	buying and inventories, and has admirably controlled costs in a
	time that they needed to."
	    The stock jumped 2-1/2 to 98-3/4.
	    Smith said the company ended 1986 with a strong cash
	position of about 639 mln dlrs as compared to 158 mln dlrs the
	year before. "This implies the possibility of a share buyback,
	or significant dividend increase or a stock split," he said.
	    In addition, he said the company has been gradually
	adjusting its merchandise mix and its gross margins have been
	improving.
	    Smith expects the company to earn 8.25-to-8.50 dlrs a share
	in 1987 as compared to the 7.06 dlrs a share earned last year.
	Last year's results include a 69 cent charge for the buyback of
	debt.

	U.S. MARCH RETAIL SALES CUT BY LATE EASTER
TOPICS:
	retail
PLACES:
	usa
CONTENT:
	U.S. retailers' lackluster March sales
	were due to a late Easter, according to analysts who expect a
	recovery in April.
	    "Sales look soft because of the Easter shift, but
	underlying business is better than the numbers indicate," said
	Bear Stearns analyst Monroe Greenstein.
	     Analysts generally average the sales results of March and
	April to account for the variation of Easter's occurance. This
	year, Easter is being observed on April 19, which is three
	weeks later than last year.
	    Analyst Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook Associates said
	sales for March rose an unadjusted 2.5 to 3.0 pct, and a
	seasonally adjusted 5.5 pct to six pct, compared to an adjusted
	5.7 pct last year.
	    "The obvious question is whether these numbers indicate
	that the consumer activity is slowing, but it does not appear
	to be because liquidity and employment are rising," said
	analyst Jeff Edelman, analyst of Drexel Lambert and Burnham.
	    Overall, analysts said first half sales are coming in
	according to expectations. Sales for all of 1987 are expected
	to rise about 5.5 pct to six pct, up a bit from 1986's rise.
	     In March, sales of housewares, furniture and big ticket
	items were stronger than apparel sales, signaling to many
	analysts that apparel sales will be strong in April as the
	holiday nears.
	    "Sales gains in home appliances and home fashions reflect a
	continuing strength in the housing market," said Edward
	Brennan, chairman of Sears Roebuck and Co <S> which reported an
	overall sales gain of 4.2 pct. Brennan said sales of women's
	sportswear were also excellent.
	    "Sears' total apparel sales was up only modestly, but even
	a modest improvement in apparel is a very good accomplishment
	due to the fact that most people will buy apparel in April,"
	said C.J. Lawrence analysts Harry Mortner. 
	    J.C. Penney Co Inc <JCP> and Dayton Hudson Corp <DH> were
	among the weaker performers with comparable stores sales
	declining 1.5 pct and 4.9 pct, respectively. Penney's store and
	catalog sales declined 1.3 pct overall and Dayton Hudson's
	overall sales rose 4.8 pct.
	    Penney chairman William Howell said, "Sales continued
	strong for catalog operations and, geographically, ranged from
	very active in the east to weak in the economically depressed
	southwest."
	    "Penney's been shifting away from leisure time activity
	wear to other apparel lines, which yield higher profit margins,
	but are currently hurting sales," said Greenstein of Bear
	Stearns.
	    Hudson chairman Kenneth Mackes cited the late Easter for
	the decline. Edelman of Drexel said that "Hudson had a tougher
	comparison because it had an exceptionally good 1986."
	    Most analysts agreed that promotions are slightly lower
	than last year.
	    "Retailers are not planning for much - inventories are
	being kept lean, markdowns are lower than last year, but sales
	are coming through anyway," said CJ Analyst Harry Mortner.
	    Mortner said he expects profits in the first quarter to  
	be better than he had originally expected in the beginning of
	the year.
	    Most retailers report their first quarter in the middle of
	May.

	FEBRUARY U.S. RETAIL SALES NOT SIGN OF UPTURN
TOPICS:

PLACES:
	usa
CONTENT:
	U.S. retailers posted stronger than
	expected sales in February, but not enough to prompt analysts
	to change their expectations of sluggish sales growth for the
	first half of 1987.
	     "My feeling is that it (February) borrowed some of the
	business we normally see later in the quarter and the real
	strength of general merchandise sales will be in the second
	half of 1987," said Bear Stearns and Co analyst Monroe
	Greenstein.
	    "I don't think March will be as strong because Easter falls
	in April this year," said Morgan Stanley analyst Walter Loeb.
	   Analysts generally average the sales results of March and
	April to account for the variation of Easter's occurrence.
	    Analyst Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook Associates said
	sales for February rose between six and 6.5 pct, compared to a
	3.6 pct increase last year.
	     Analysts noted that February is considered a small,
	transitory month between winter and spring.
	    In addition, sales comparisons were boosted by an
	especially soft February last year which was adversely affected
	by severe weather.
	    Apparel sales outshone other product groups in sales,
	according to retailers and analysts.
	    "February's strong sales reflected a lot of fresh
	merchandise on the shelves and higher consumer income due to
	tax reductions," said Greenstein of Bear Stearns.
	    Analysts expect apparel sales to remain good as sales of
	durable and houseware items grow softer due to the continuing
	high levels of consumer debt.
	     May Department Stores Co <MAY> and K Mart Corp <KM> were
	among the strong performers, posting comparable store sales
	gains of 9.4 pct and 8.2 pct, respectively. May had an overall
	sales gain of 15.0 pct and K Mart had a 13.1 pct sales gain 
	last month.
	    "Favorable consumer response to our merchandise programs
	continued to positively impact our sales comparisons. IN
	addition to the strong contribution by K Mart stores, all our
	specialty retailing companies had excellent February sales,"
	said K Mart chairman Bernard Fauber.
	    Sears Roebuck and Co <S> posted a 4.9 pct increase.
	"Domestic sales were led by better than average increases in
	apparel, home fashions and hardware and especially strong
	catalog sales," said Sears chairman Edward Brennan.
	    Analysts were a little disappointed by J.C. Penney Co Inc
	<JCP> which started out with especially strong sales early in
	the month. Penney posted a 5.5 pct increase on a comparitive
	store basis and a 5.3 pct gain in overall sales.
	    Penney chairman William Howell said, "store sales were
	strongest during the early part of the month, while catalog
	demand was consistently strong throughout the period.
	    Store sales activity varied throughout the country, ranging
	from good in the East to weak in the depressed southwest.
	    Analysts also said gross profit margins were high as
	retailers were not overly promotional due to leaner inventories
	than a year ago.
	    "February is not a big month seasonally but these numbers
	suggest a fairly good trend for consumer spending," said Drexel
	Burnham Lambert analyst Jeff Edelman.

	    The company said it will make the proposal to shareowners
