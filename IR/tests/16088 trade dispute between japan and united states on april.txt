	SENATE PREPARING FOR NEW U.S. BUDGET BATTLE
TOPICS:
	trade
PLACES:
	usa
CONTENT:
	Congress returned from its Easter
	recess ready for the annual Spring budget battle that promises
	to be a partisan dispute.
	    The budget fight pitting Democrats against President Reagan
	and Republicans is expected to get underway this week in the
	Senate late this week and last at least another week. It is
	taking on new prominence because of current trade woes.
	    That is because the budget problems and its associated huge
	deficits are said to be at the root of related international
	trade friction currently worrying financiers.
	    As the dollar slides downward on global markets and stock
	exchanges gyrate wildly, the trade dispute involving the United
	States and Japan once again is spreading fears of a major trade
	war between the two trading giants for the first time since
	World War II.
	    Ostensibly that dispute is over U.S. charges that Japan is
	refusing to open its markets to semi-conductor chips and the
	resulting U.S. tariffs doubling prices of Japanese televisions
	and small computers.
	    Behind the elements of a brewing trade war which neither
	side wants, is the dilemma of the U.S. budget and its deficit.
	    Some analysts say the financial markets may be waking up to
	the economic realities that the huge debt cannot continue to
	grow without repercussions.
	    A large portion of the U.S. debt has been financed by
	foreigners from their accumulated trade surpluses. But if they
	withdraw this support the result can only be further problems,
	including higher interest rates for Americans.
	    In a nutshell, the U.S. budget process has now moved to the
	showdown stages in Congress. Reagan's own trillion dollar
	spending budget for the government year 1988, starting Oct. 1,
	was trounced badly in the House on April 9.
	    The Senate takes up a plan similar to one that passed the
	House, calling for slashing the deficit from its estimated 171
	billion dlr level next year to about 134 billion dlrs, through
	defense and domestic spending cuts and about 18.5 billion dlrs
	in new, unspecified, taxes. As the Senate prepares to take up
	its own budget plan, majority Democrats predict there will be
	passage of a bill, only after a protracted partisan battle.
	    In the House, not one Republican voted for the budget,
	which passed by 230 to 192. In the Senate, none of Reagan's
	Republicans voted for the budget as it passed out of the Senate
	Budget Committee for full Senate consideration.
	    A key Senate Budget Committee source told Reuters he
	believes this very unusual unanimous opposition was by design
	among congressional Republicans, perhaps with the tacit
	approval of the White House.
	    "Republicans want Democrats to take the heat for any tax
	hikes and defense cuts," he said.
	    In the coming weeks, the source said, Democrats will press
	for a bipartisan budget and seek a negotiated budget with
	Reagan -- who already is opposed to the idea. But "it is not
	clear how the Republicans will act," he added.
	    He said Republicans may propose their own plan for lower
	taxes and more defense spending, which they did not offer after
	Reagan's budget was clobbered in an early vote in the House.
	     When Reagan entered the White House in 1981, he inherited
	what was labelled a huge deficit from Jimmy Carter that wound
	up to be nearly 79 billion dlrs that year.
	    Despite Reagan's promise to balance the budget by 1983,
	critics note that his administration's record of accumulated
	debt is estimated over one trillion dlrs, or 1,100 billion
	dlrs.
	    That is money the government must borrow, and pay back, and
	many analysts say it is what kept the dollar high and caused
	the worst U.S. trade deficit ever.
	     Last year the United States bought goods from the world
	worth 169.8 billion dlrs more than what it sold, including
	purchases of 58.6 billion dlrs in Japanese goods.
	    While Congress is trying to attack the trade deficit on one
	front through a get-tough trade bill promising retaliatory
	measures unless all markets are opened, its success so far
	against the budget deficit has been marked by limited progress.
	    Congress, which controls the pursestrings, has put the
	deficit on a downward path from its record high of 220.7
	billion dlrs accumulated in fiscal 1986, which ended Sept. 30.
	    Because of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings balanced budget law
	enacted in late 1985, there has been pressure on Congress to do
	more than talk about deficits.
	    That law, named after Republican Senators Phil Gramm of
	Texas, Warren Rudman of New Hampshire and Democrat Ernest
	Hollings of South Carolina, calls for a balanced budget by 1991
	through a series of set deficit targets that Congress must meet.
	    The law has been followed, even though an enforcement
	mechanism to mandate automatic across-the-board cuts if
	Congress misses its goal was stricken by the Supreme Court.
	    The legislators have followed the targets -- on paper. But
	in reality, the goal has actually been missed. For example,
	Congress last year approved legislation to meet the 1987 target
	of a 144 billion dlr deficit. But even after approving the
	numbers, the deficit for 1987 is estimated at over 170 billion
	dlrs -- far off the target.
	    This year the target is 108 billion dlrs and that goal is
	expected to be missed widely.

	U.S. SEES MORE HARMONY IN TALKS WITH FRANCE

	The U.S. Expects more harmonious
	talks than usual during French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac's
	first official visit this week as frequently rancorous disputes
	between the two countries begin to fade.
	    "The Libyan bombing is a thing of the past, the trade war
	didn't happen and we have reached reasonably good cooperation
	on terrorism," one U.S. Official told Reuters.
	    "It looks like a reasonably harmonious visit in prospect,
	more harmonious than usual."
	    Since taking office a year ago, Chirac has been obliged to
	deal with a series of potentially serious disputes with the
	United States.
	    During the U.S. Bombing of alleged terrorist targets in
	Libya last April, France refused to allow British-based U.S.
	Planes to overfly its territory, forcing them to take a
	circuitous route. That angered Washington.
	    The U.S. Officials, who asked not to be identified, said a
	year ago Washington felt the French were not taking strong
	enough action against terrorism. "Now they are. We're pleased
	and they are pleased that we are pleased," one said.
	    More recently, a dispute over U.S. Access to the grain
	markets of Spain and Portugal after they joined the European
	Community  threatened to become a trade war.
	    In retaliation for what Washington saw as deliberate
	Community moves to exclude U.S. Grain, the United States was
	poised to impose swingeing tariffs on European Community food
	imports and a major trade war was averted at the last minute.
	    Last week, the forces of President Hissene Habre of Chad,
	supported, trained and armed by Paris and Washington, scored a
	major success by pushing Libyan troops out of their last bases
	in northern Chad.
	    A French official added: "There is also a common interest in
	getting Japan to cut its trade surplus with the rest of the
	world by opening up its markets."
	    Although relations have improved markedly between the two
	countries, many irritants remain. At the top of the list is the
	Community's common agricultural policy (CAP).
	    To Washington, as one official put it, "CAP is the root of
	all evil" in international food trade because it subsidises
	farmers and sells vast amounts of excess produce at below world
	prices, thereby eating into U.S. Markets.

	JAPAN HAS LITTLE NEW TO OFFER IN MICROCHIP DISPUTE
TOPICS:
	trade
PLACES:

CONTENT:
	The Japanese government appears to have
	little new to offer to settle a dispute with the U.S. Over
	computer chips, trade analysts and government officials said.
	    The U.S. Has threatened to impose tariffs worth up to 300
	mln dlrs on Japanese electronics exports to the U.S., In
	retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to keep a pact on the
	microchip trade signed last September.
	    A Foreign Ministry official told Reuters "Japan has done
	what it can, and now we must persuade the United States to wait
	for those steps to take effect."
	    The U.S. Alleges that, in defiance of the September
	agreement, Japan is still selling microchips at below cost in
	non-U.S. Markets and refusing to open Japan further to U.S.
	Chip sales. U.S. Tariffs are due to take effect on April 17.
	     Analysts noted Japan's Ministry of International Trade and
	Industry (MITI) has already ordered chipmakers to cut
	production in order to dry up the source of cheap chips sold in
	third countries at non-regulated prices.
	    "I'm not sure MITI can do much more than it has," said
	Jardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd analyst Nick Edwards.
	    A MITI official said the Ministry was not planning to call
	for production cuts beyond those already sought, although it
	would continue to press chip users to buy more foreign goods.
	    Spokesmen for some Japanese electronics firms said they
	would consider buying more U.S. Chips. But a Matsushita
	Electric Industrial Co spokesman said a rapid increase in
	imports was not likely.
	    Most analysts said Japanese exporters would be hard hit if
	the United States did implement the tariffs, which would be
	levied on consumer electronics products rather than on
	microchips themselves.
	    "If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time,
	there will be complete erosion of exports to the United States,"
	said Tom Murtha, analyst at James Capel and Co.
	    "The Japanese electronics industry is too powerful to be
	stopped altogether, but recovery for the industry will be
	delayed for another year," he said.
	    Some analysts said tariffs would also harm U.S. Industry by
	stepping up offshore production and by reducing demand in Japan
	for semiconductors U.S. Firms are trying to sell here.
	    "The American approach is full of contradictions," Jardine
	Fleming's Edwards said.
	    "If they want to expand (U.S.) exports, the last thing they
	want to do is hit the makers of the final products because that
	hurts the final market," Edwards said.
	    But other analysts said the dispute reflects not just U.S.
	Concern over what it sees as a strategic industry, but also
	frustration with Japan's vast trade surplus. Some analysts
	argued that to solve the semiconductor problem Japan may have
	to take action beyond that pledged in the semiconductor pact.
	    Carole Ryavec, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd,
	said "The major overall issue is to stimulate the domestic
	economy and move away from an export-dependent economy."

	TRANSATLANTIC ROW IMPERILS LOUVRE ACCORD-DEALERS
TOPICS:

CONTENT:
	The Louvre accord on currency stability,
	which has maintained an uneasy calm in currency markets since
	last February, appeared in serious danger today as a
	transatlantic dispute over West German interest rates came to
	the boil, foreign exchange dealers said.
	    But as the dollar slid against the mark and world stock and
	bond markets plunged, officials in the major industrial
	countries played down the dispute as a bilateral problem
	between the United States and West Germany and insisted that
	the currency pact was still alive.
	    U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker sparked the market
	fears when he attacked the rise in West German short-term
	interest rates. "That's not in keeping with the spirit of what
	we agreed to as recently as earlier this month in Washington,"
	Baker said in a U.S. Television interview on Sunday. He was
	referring to the meetings of Finance Ministers from the Group
	of Seven (G7) leading industrial nations which reaffirmed the
	pact.
	    Under the Louvre Accord West Germany and Japan, who both
	have large trade surpluses, pledged to boost their economic
	growth to take in more exports from the U.S., While the U.S.
	Agreed to stop talking the dollar down.
	    However, Baker said on Saturday that while the Louvre
	agreement was still operative, the West German interest rate
	move would force the U.S. To re-examine the accord.
	    "The foreign exchange market has been told by Baker that
	he's going to hammer Germany ... He has just declared all bets
	are off in terms of currency cooperation," Chris Johns, currency
	analyst at UBS-Phillips and Drew in London said.
	    But a Bank of Japan official took a much more sanguine
	view, telling Reuters that "the exchange market is apparently
	reacting too much, and anyone who sold the dollar on the Baker
	comment will regret it later on."
	    French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur, who hosted the
	Louvre meeting, was the only one of the G7 Finance Ministers to
	respond directly to Baker's remarks. He called for "a faithful
	and firm adherence by all the major industrial countries to the
	Louvre accords -- in both their letter and spirit."
	    Neither the West German Finance Ministry nor the British
	Treasury commented on the row.
	    But a Japanese Finance Ministry official said that despite
	U.S. Frustration over higher interest rates abroad, "this does
	not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework of the
	Louvre Accord."
	    In Frankfurt F. Wilhelm Christians, joint chief executive
	of West Germany's largest bank, Deutsche Bank, said that
	following recent meetings with Baker, he believed that the U.S.
	Was still committed to the accord.
	    In a move which the market interpreted as a possible
	gesture of reconciliation, the Bundesbank added short-term
	liquidity to the West German money market at 3.80 pct on
	Monday, down from the 3.85 pct level at which it injected
	medium-term liquidity last week. The Bank of France also
	stepped into the French money market to hold down rates,
	injecting short-term liquidity at 7-3/4 pct after rates rose
	close to eight pct.

	NAKASONE SOUNDS CONCILIATORY NOTE IN CHIP DISPUTE
TOPICS:

PLACES:

CONTENT:
	Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone sounded
	a conciliatory note in Japan's increasingly bitter row with the
	United States over trade in computer microchips.
	    "Japan wants to resolve the issue through consultations by
	explaining its stance thoroughly and correcting the points that
	need to be corrected," he was quoted by Kyodo News Service as
	saying.
	    While expressing regret over America's decision to impose
	tariffs on imports of Japanese electrical goods, Nakasone said
	Tokyo was willing to send a high-level official to Washington
	to help settle the dispute.
	    Government officials said Japan would make a formal request
	next week for emergency talks and that the two sides would
	probably meet the week after, just days before the April 17
	deadline set by Washington for the tariffs to take effect.
	    Tokyo is expected to propose a joint U.S./Japan
	investigation of American claims that Japanese companies are
	dumping cut-price chips in Asian markets.
	    Yesterday, Washington announced plans to put as much as 300
	mln dlrs in tariffs on imports of certain Japanese electronic
	goods in retaliation for what it sees as Tokyo's failure to
	live up to their bilateral chip pact.
	    That agreement, hammered out late last year after months of
	heated negotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price
	chips in world markets and to buy more American-made chips.
	    Nakasone's comments seemed distinctly more conciliatory
	than those of his Trade and Industry Minister, Hajime Tamura,
	who earlier today said Japan was ready to take "appropriate
	measures" if Washington went ahead with the sanctions.
	    Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)
	officials later sought to downplay the significance of Tamura's
	remark and said that his main message was that the two sides
	need to talk urgently about the issue.
	    But they admitted that Japan was considering taking the
	United States to GATT, the Geneva-based international
	organization which polices world trade, if Washington imposed
	the tariffs.
	    Any Japanese action would probably be taken under Article
	23 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), they
	said. If that article were invoked, GATT would set up a panel
	to consider the legality of the U.S. Action.
	    But officials here said they hope that can be avoided. "It
	may be wishful thinking but there is a possibility the United
	States may lift its decision at an early date," Tamura said.
	    In announcing the U.S. Sanctions yesterday, President
	Ronald Reagan said he was prepared to lift them once he had
	evidence that Japan was no longer dumping chips in world
	markets and had opened up its own market to imports.
	    Japanese government officials said they are confident they
	can make the pact work.
	    They said that the export of cut-price Japanese chips
	through unregulated distributors has all but dried up after
	MITI instructed domestic makers to cut output.
	    While acknowledging that it is harder to increase Japanese
	imports of American chips, MITI officials said that the
	ministry is doing all it can to ensure that happens.
	    The Ministry recently called on Japan's major chip users,
	some of whom are also leading producers, to step up their
	purchases of foreign semiconductors.
	    A spokesman for one of the companies, Toshiba Corp <TSBA.T>
	said his firm would do just that and could announce its plans
	in the next week or so. He expects other Japanese companies to
	do likewise.

	TRADE FRICTION THREATENS TO TOPPLE NAKASONE
TOPICS:

CONTENT:
	Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone may have
	been dealt a fatal political blow by the yen's renewed rapid
	rise and the threat of a trade war with the United States,
	political analysts said.
	    Nakasone, already under fire over an unpopular tax reform
	plan, may now be forced to resign before the June economic
	summit of seven industrialised nations if local elections later
	next month go against candidates from his ruling Liberal
	Democratic Party (LDP), they said.
	    "The close relationship between Nakasone and President
	Reagan was an important element of Nakasone's power base,"
	Waseda University Political Science Professor Mitsuru Uchida
	told Reuters. "So the emergence of U.S. Criticism damages
	Nakasone."
	    Even before the latest trade friction flared, Nakasone was
	encountering criticism not only from opposition parties but
	also within his own LDP over his proposal to levy a sales tax.
	    "Many factions within the LDP are distancing themselves from
	Nakasone," Uchida said. "His position within the LDP itself is
	not so strongly established today."
	    Nakasone, who has been more popular with the general public
	than with many LDP members, is now seeing his public support
	eroded, the analysts said.
	    The yen's rise to record highs and the U.S. Threat on
	Friday to impose tariffs on Japanese electronics goods in
	retaliation for Japan's alleged violation of a microchip trade
	pact are now giving Nakasone's critics fresh ammunition, the
	analysts said.
	    "Apparently the special relationship between Reagan and
	Nakasone hasn't worked effectively," Rei Shiratori, director of
	the Institute for Political Studies in Japan, said.
	    This is making the Japanese people doubt Nakasone's
	credibility, Shiratori told Reuters.
	    The cumulative impact of the sales tax issue, the yen's
	rise and mounting trade friction could mean serious LDP losses
	in the April 11 and 26 local elections, analysts said.
	    "If the elections go against the LDP, Nakasone may have to
	resign early," Shiratori said.
	    But Nakasone still has a chance to soothe U.S. Tempers
	before or during his week-long Washington visit from April 29,
	some analysts said.
	    However, "unless the Japanese political system can move more
	quickly to give Nakasone some nice present to take to
	Washington on smouldering trade issues, he will face a very
	hostile audience," said Merrill Lynch Securities economist
	William Sterling.
	    "If the trip is a major disaster, it would seem to put the
	final nail in his coffin," he said.
	    Reagan's own weakened domestic position, and growing
	Republican as well as Democratic anger with Japan, argue
	against a quick settlement to the trade dispute, the analysts
	said.
	    But a desire on both sides to find some solution, coupled
	with uncertainty at home and abroad over likely successors to
	Nakasone, could still lead to an attempt to paper over the
	differences and aid Nakasone, they said.
	    "One factor against a trade war may be that Washington is
	not anxious to push Nakasone into his grave," Sterling said.

	TALKS WILL NOT DELAY TRADE CURBS AGAINST JAPAN

CONTENT:
	President Reagan's move to impose
	stiff tariffs on Japanese goods stems from deep U.S.
	frustration over Japan's trade policy, and he has no intention
	of calling off the sanctions, trade analysts said.
	    U.S. officials put down any idea of delaying imposing the
	300 mln dlrs in tariffs, despite seemingly contradictory
	comments by some Administration aides.
	    And, they add, a visit here next week by Japanese trade
	officials and a visit to Tokyo by a senior State Department
	official will likely do nothing to change U.S. minds.
	    "Do not expect the problem to be resolved or the sanctions
	not to go into effect," said a senior U.S. trade official.
	    Reagan last Friday announced that on April 17 he would
	raise tariffs on certain Japanese exports to penalize Japan for
	breaking a 1986 pact governing trade in semiconductors.
	    The United States says the Japanese have not lived up to
	their pledge to stop dumping semiconductors in third country
	markets at less than production costs or to open their home
	market to U.S. semiconductors. Semiconductors - tiny silicon
	memory chips - are integral components of modern electronic
	goods ranging from television sets and personal computers to
	guidance systems on aircraft.
	    Some U.S. officials had hinted that the United States and
	Japan might come to terms on their semiconductor dispute in
	time to cancel the planned tariffs, but this has now been
	dismissed by other senior officials.
	    They noted that negotiations over compliance with the pact
	had been going on for several months, with little success.
	    Japanese firms this week announced plans to cut chip output
	and increase U.S. chip imports, but U.S. officials said Japan's
	move was too late to stave off the American tariffs.
	    The tariffs are to be imposed after a period of public
	comment, but Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and other
	officials have said neither the comment period or the U.S. and
	Japanese trade talks will serve to delay the tariffs.
	    Baldrige predicted the dispute would be resolved, but said
	"I'm sure the sanctions will go in before we work it out."
	    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that while he
	hoped something could be done to hold off the sanctions, "it
	probably is not likely."
	    And U.S. Trade Represenative Clayton Yeutter predicted that
	Japan would not be able to comply with the pact in time to hold
	off the new tariffs on goods including personal computers,
	television sets, power tools and electric motors.
	    Trade analysts said that in any case, the U.S.-Japanese
	semiconductor dispute was only one of many and trade frictions
	that will continue until Japan ended a policy of predatory
	pricing and opened its home market to foreign goods.
	    Other disputes include Japanese prevention of U.S. firms
	from taking part in building a new eight billion dlr airport
	near Osaka and selling a wide variety of goods in Japan,
	including many agriculture products.
	    A new trade row has now arisen over a Japanese decision to
	limit foreign participation in its telecommunication market.
	    U.S. officials have said the American telecommunications
	market is open to foreign firms and it was only fair trade to
	open the Japanese market to 33 per cent foreign participation,
	as Japan had previously agreed.
	    Britain has also protested the Japanese limitations.
	    American and Japanese negotiators are meeting to try to
	resolve the issue, officials said, but there was no sign of any
	early settlement.

	Japan is doing all it can to solve its
	trade problems with the United States but the two nations will
	remain at odds as long as the trade account is lopsided in
	Japan's favour, a senior official said.
	    "So long as there is an external imbalance there will be
	trade friction and ...Harsh words between the two governments,"
	the Foreign Ministry official told reporters.
	    Last year, Japan racked up a 51.5 billion dlr surplus with
	the United States and economists said they do not see it
	falling significantly any time soon.
	    Washington announced plans last week to slap up to 300 mln
	dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods, raising the
	spectre of a trade war between the two countries.
	    "We take the current situation very seriously," said the
	official, who declined to be identified. "The basic stance of
	the Japanese government is to tackle the issues with all
	available resources."
	    The United States has accused Japan of reneging on an
	agreement that called on it to stop selling cut-price computer

	JAPAN/U.S. WILL BE AT ODDS WHILE TRADE LOPSIDED

	Japan is doing all it can to solve its
	trade problems with the United States but the two nations will
	remain at odds as long as the trade account is lopsided in
	Japan's favour, a senior official said.
	    "So long as there is an external imbalance there will be
	trade friction and ...Harsh words between the two governments,"
	the Foreign Ministry official told reporters.
	    Last year, Japan racked up a 51.5 billion dlr surplus with
	the United States and economists said they do not see it
	falling significantly any time soon.
	    Washington announced plans last week to slap up to 300 mln
	dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods, raising the
	spectre of a trade war between the two countries.
	    "We take the current situation very seriously," said the
	official, who declined to be identified. "The basic stance of
	the Japanese government is to tackle the issues with all
	available resources."
	    The United States has accused Japan of reneging on an
	agreement that called on it to stop selling cut-price computer
	microchips in world markets and to try to import more American
	semiconductors. Tokyo has denied the charges.

	TALKS FAIL TO HEAD OFF CHIP SHOWDOWN WITH JAPAN
TOPICS:

	usa, japan
CONTENT:
	Talks between the United States
	and Japan on alleged Japanese dumping of computer microchips
	have failed to head off U.S. imposition of retaliatory tariffs,
	two senior White House officials said.
	    President Reagan's chief of staff, Howard Baker told
	reporters here that he saw no developments that that would
	cause the president to back away from his plan to issue a
	proclamation on Friday slapping 100 per cent tariffs on a range
	of Japanese electronic products.
	    "I assume that there will be a proclamation on Friday,"
	Baker said.
	    Reagan's National Security Adviser, Frank Carlucci added,
	"It looks like a very difficult situation at this point."
	    Carlucci said that evidence of Japanese "dumping" of
	microchips had been "fairly conclusive." The alleged dumping --
	selling abroad at below the cost of manufacture -- is said to
	have undercut the technologically important U.S. microchip
	industry.
	    Carlucci also said that although Japanese officials had
	presented statistics designed to show that Japan was opening
	its markets to American producers of microchips, "our
	statistics do not confirm this."
	    "Indeed, they tend to go in the other direction,"Carlucci
	said.
	    President Reagan announced on March 27 that he planned to
	raise tariffs on as much as 300 mln dlrs in Japanese exports to
	the United States.
	    He accused Japan of failing to enforce major provisions of
	a September 1986 agreement on preventing microchip dumping and
	providing American industry with fair trade opportunities.
	    He said he would be prepared to lift the sanctions when
	Japan took corrective action on these two issues.
	    The dispute has soured U.S.-Jpanese relations as Japanese
	Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone prepares to visit Washington
	at the end of the month for talks with Reagan.
	    Last Friday Reagan, answering questions following a speech
	to the Los Angeles World Affairs Council, said Nakasone had
	endangered his political standing at home because of his
	willingess to try to eliminate trade barriers against U.S.
	goods.
	    He said he was looking forward to his talks with Nakasone
	and "he has been most helpful."
	    Today Reagan was vacationing at his ranch near here.

	LYNG SETS TOUGH U.S. STANCE WITH JAPAN ON BEEF
TOPICS:
	livestock, carcass, trade
PLACES:
	usa, japan
CONTENT:
	U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard
	Lyng warned Japan that the failure to remove a longstanding 
	import quota on Japanese beef might spark a protectionist
	response in the United States.
	    "Given the protectionist mood in the Congress and the
	country, if I were a leader in Japan I would certainly be very
	concerned...and the failure to remove it (the beef quota) might
	be very serious," Lyng told a group of U.S cattlemen.
	    Lyng said he and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter,
	during a visit to Japan later this month, will demand "total
	elimination" of the beef import quota by April 1988.
	    The current dispute with Japan over semiconductor may
	strengthen the U.S. stance in farm trade negotiations, Lyng
	said, because Japan does not want a trade war with the U.S.
	    Lyng dismissed recent statements in Tokyo that Japan might
	retaliate against U.S. products as a result of the
	semiconductor dispute.
	    "They (Japan) aren't going to pick a fight with us," Lyng
	said, adding that with its huge bilateral trade surplus Japan
	has more to lose in a trade war than the United States.
	    Lyng told the U.S. cattlemen that the quota on Japanese
	beef imports does not allow consumers there an adequate choice
	in food purchases.
	    He said in addition to beef, the U.S. will press for
	eliminiation of import barriers on Japan's citrus and rice as
	well.
	    Lyng noted that Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. farm
	products, principally grains and soybeans.

	U.S. TAX AGENCY INCREASES INTERNATIONAL AUDITS
TOPICS:
	
PLACES:
	usa
CONTENT:
	The Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
	said it was stepping up compliance efforts by its international
	staff to recover some of the billions of dollars lost each year
	in unpaid taxes.
	    The agency was shifting emphasis by its international
	branch to increase compliance by the 47,000 foreign-owned
	American companies and foreign firms operating in the United
	States, IRS officials said at a news conference.
	    The IRS also was taking a closer look at compliance by
	Americans living abroad and by taxpayers in the United States
	with income from overseas investments.
	    Percy Woodard, assistant IRS commissioner, international,
	denied that the agency was picking on foreign companies, but he
	said fewer of them pay taxes than comparable U.S. firms.
	    In some industries, one pct of foreign firms paid U.S.
	taxes, he said. Other IRS staff said the taxes paid by foreign
	companies ranged from 16 to 19 pct less than taxes paid by U.S.
	firms.
	    "If our taxpayers in another country are expected to fulfill
	their tax-paying responsibilities in that country, then
	foreigners in our country can be expected to do the same thing,"
	Woodard said.
	    In addition, as many as 61 pct of the 2.5 mln Americans who
	live abroad do not file tax returns, costing the government 2.3
	billion dlrs a year, Woodard said.
	    The total tax gap -- the difference between taxes owed and
	actually paid to the government -- is about 90 billion dlrs.
	    Millions of dollars are lost because Americans fail to
	report foreign income and because U.S. businesses with foreign
	operations can underreport income, Woodard said.
	    The IRS will increase compliance by reassigning 100    
	examiners to international tax returns, a 25-pct increase,
	which should lead to more tax return audits.
	    The IRS will study entire industries to spot trends or
	practices by foreign-owned companies in their compliance with
	tax laws, Woodard said.
	    The IRS looked at the electronics industry first, but
	Woodard denied it was because of the trade dispute over
	semiconductors between the United States and Japan.
	    The agency next will turn its attention to the automobile,
	computer and motorcycle industries.
	    The IRS will also receive information on anyone who applies
	for a U.S. passport or permanent residence in the United States
	to help indentify those who do not file returns.

	EUROPEAN COMMUNITY CRITICISES U.S TRADE MEASURES
TOPICS:

CONTENT:
	The European Community (EC) accused the
	United States of violating a political commitment to free trade
	through practices including a tax on imported gasoline and a
	customs user fee.
	    EC ambassador Tran Van-Thinh made the formal charge to the
	surveillance body of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
	(GATT), GATT spokesman David Woods told reporters.
	    Woods also said the EC was joined by the United States in
	criticising Brazil for extending its list of products for which
	import licenses have been temporarily suspended, so as to
	improve its balance of payments.
	    The United States charged Japan with violating GATT rules
	by restricting imports of agricultural products through an
	import licensing system. The United States asked for
	consultations with Tokyo on the issue.
	    Tran charged that the trade measures contravened a
	political commitment to halt and reverse trade barriers,
	pledged by ministers in Punta del Este last September.
	    When ministers established the four year Uruguay round to
	negotiate freer trade in 13 areas, they set up the GATT
	surveillance body to monitor this commitment, known in GATT
	jargon as "standstill and rollback."
	    Tran criticised Washington for the "superfund" tax on oil
	imports, a customs user fee, and the removal of a special
	machine tool (known as category FSC34) from its government
	procurement list for reasons of national security.
	    Warren Lavorel, a U.S. Trade official, defended the
	policies, saying they did not violate GATT trade rules.
	    The surveillance body will send a record of today's talks
	to the Trade Negotiating Committee, which oversees the round,
	to decide any further action on the charges.
	    The oil tax and customs user fee have already been the
	subject of formal GATT dispute panels set up outside the
	Uruguay Round to rule on the legality of the practices.
	    The ruling GATT Council yesterday adopted a dispute panel's
	report and ruled that the U.S. Superfund tax on oil imports
	breached trade rules. It called on Washington to modify its
	legislation.
	    Mexico and Canada, along with the European Community,
	brought the dispute to the GATT last year.

	YEUTTER BLAMES OVERPRODUCTION FOR TRADE PROBLEMS

	Over-investment and over-production are
	at the root of many of the difficult trade issues that have
	soured relations between the United States and some of its
	major trading partners, trade representative Clayton Yeutter
	said.
	    He told a conference, held by the University of Chicago's
	Graduate Business School, that much of this was caused by
	governments "getting their finger in the pot."
	    Yeutter referred specifically to the problems of
	agricultural trade, where subsidized exports have been a point
	of contention most notably between the United States and the
	European Community.
	    "Think of the vast waste of financial and other resources,"
	he said.
	    Yeutter said much of the problem underlying the dispute
	with Japan over semiconductors was due to overproduction.
	    The trade representative called for a long-term approach to
	international trade and said the recent commitment to a
	free-trade agreement between the United States and Canada was a
	step in the right direction.
	    There's a lot of work to be done in the next six months,
	but we have set October 1 as a target date for an agreement to
	be reached, he added.
	    "We're trying to create an environment that will facilitate
