	PHILIPPINES SEES 1987 GOVERNMENT REVENUE UP 26 PCT
TOPICS:

PLACES:
	philippines
CONTENT:
	Philippine government revenue is
	expected to rise 26 pct to 99.9 billion pesos this year from
	79.1 billion in 1986, Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin said.
	    In a report to President Corazon Aquino on his department's
	performance during the year ended February 28, Ongpin said at
	least 15.9 billion pesos were expected to accrue from new tax
	reform measures announced last year.
	    He said the goal for official development assistance (ODA)
	this year is two billion dlrs, adding that aid donors have
	committed ODA inflows of 1.7 billion dlrs in 1987, up 30 pct
	from 1.3 billion in 1986.
	    Ongpin said steps planned to provide a sound revenue base
	included a value added tax (VAT) system due to be introduced in
	1988. He gave no other details.
	    He said treasury bill maturities, interest rate levels and
	the volume of government securities sold to the private sector
	have improved significantly. "In particular, short-term prime
	interest rates which had gone over 40 pct in 1985, are now down
	to less than 10 pct," he said.
	    Ongpin said the government's debt-equity scheme, introduced
	in August last year, had attracted more than 276 mln dlrs worth
	of applications, but selective evaluation had resulted in
	approvals of only 61.8 mln dlrs at end-February.
	    He said his department aims to accelerate its privatisation
	program and the sale of non-performing assets owned by
	associates of former President Ferdinand Marcos to achieve a
	1987 sales target of four billion pesos which would help
	finance land reform.
	    Aquino said earlier this month that all the 24 billion
	pesos the government hopes to raise from the sale of the failed
	companies will be used to finance the land reform plan.
	    Ongpin also said the government would pursue efforts to
	obtain 500 mln dlrs in concessional funding for the program
	from a World Bank-led consultative group of multilateral and
	bilateral aid donors.
	    The government has said the land reform plan aims to
	distribute 9.7 mln hectares of land to poor peasants.

	PHILIPPINE DEBT PACT SEEN AS GOOD FOR ECONOMY

	The Philippines' restructuring of 13.2
	billion dlrs of foreign debt will provide a welcome boost for
	the economy, but last Friday's accord with the country's
	12-bank advisory committee does not imply an overnight boom,
	bankers and businessmen polled by Reuters said.
	    "The successful negotiations form an important piece in the
	mosaic," Christian Roeher, Secretary-General of the European
	Chamber of Commerce, said. "Now is really the time for the
	government to start implementing its ideas. There has been a
	lot of talking and loud thinking."
	    Business leaders said the 17-year rescheduling of
	commercial bank debt would give President Corazon Aquino some
	badly-needed breathing space, but warned her government was
	still in the midst of political consolidation.
	    "There is a lot of interest among foreign investors in the
	country, but now they are waiting to see what happens in the
	congressional and local elections later this year," said
	American Chamber of Commerce president George Drysdale.
	    The government is serious about getting down to work, but
	there are many individual agendas for growth and no consensus.
	But each step brings a unanimity of opinion closer, he said.
	    Aurelio Periquet, President of the Philippine Chamber of
	Commerce and Industry, told Reuters the debt accord had
	positively translated the international banking community's
	confidence in the country's economy and Aquino's government.
	    "This government needs less pressure and more time and
	happily our creditors seem to see it that way," he said. "This
	accord may not result in an immediate boom, but at least it
	enhances the image of the country for foreign investors."
	    But Periquet said domestic and foreign investments fell
	short of targets in 1986. "The accord does not solve all our
	problems," he added.
	    Periquet said the question of political stability no longer
	worried Filipino businessmen, who had already started expanding
	existing businesses or investing in new areas.
	    "A number of us have already put in new money and there are
	plans for the export market," he said. "President Aquino has
	shown her ability to pull the nation out of one crisis after
	another."
	    Roeher said foreign investment would probably be held back
	until after the congressional polls in May and the local
	elections in August. "The two elections will probably have a
	more decisive effect on the way business reacts," he said.
	    "Some foreign companies are not waiting, but they are more
	the exception than the rule," Roeher said.
	    He said it was important the government ensure the creation
	of more jobs was not just a transitory development.
	    "The absorption of enormous aid given to the Philippines is
	also poor. A lot of it has not been put to use. The government
	should act without further delay to absorb the 1.7 billion dlrs
	of development aid it will receive in 1987," he said.
	    A foreign banker close to the debt negotiations said he did
	not foresee any real boom until 1989.
	    "The problem is that Aquino has inherited her political
	system from (former President Ferdinand) Marcos," the banker
	said. "There is still a clamour for the sharing of benefits,
	different sectors claiming their rights and duties. If they go
	too fast there could be another bust two years down the road."
	    Businessman Raul Concepcion, whose brother Jose is the
	country's trade and industry minister, said everyone could
	heave a sigh of relief. "Now that the debt agreement is out of
	the way, our economic and financial officials can concentrate
	on their work, like increasing government revenue and
	efficiency," he said.

	Banque Paribas, which arranged a 220
	mln dlr loan for Ecuador last year to pre-finance oil exports,
	wants to adjust the terms of the facility to help the country
	recover from a devastating earthquake, bankers said.
	    But the French bank's plan, which would effectively
	postpone repayment of about 30 mln dlrs of the loan for several
	months, is running into stiff resistance from many of the 52
	members of the loan syndicate.
	    The pipeline that carries all Ecuador's oil exports was
	ruptured in the March 5 tremor and will take some five months
	to repair at a cost of about 150 mln dlrs to repair.
	    President Leon Febres Cordero on Friday estimated total
	damages caused by the quake at one billion dlrs and said that
	Ecuador as a result would maintain January's suspension of
	interest payments on its foreign commercial bank debt.
	    Payments were halted in January because of the drop in the
	price of oil, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of Ecuador's
	export earnings and 60 pct of government revenue.
	    Although sympathetic to Ecuador's plight, many banks in the
	Paribas facility feel that emergency financial relief is a job
	for international financial organizations and not for
	commercial banks, bankers said.
	    The 18-month oil-financing facility, which was signed last
	October 28, is one of the few purely voluntary credits for a
	Latin American nation since the region's debt crisis erupted in
	August 1982.
	    Because it was a voluntary deal, many bankers feel strongly
	that the orginal terms must be adhered to. Otherwise, they
	fear, the gradual re-establishment of normal market conditions
	for Latin borrowers will be set back.
	    "There's a lot of reluctance by the other banks. They feel
	it's a different facility, and so any kind of suggestion of a
	restructuring would look bad," one banker commented.

	AUSTRALIAN OIL TAX CUT SEEN BOOSTING OUTPUT
TOPICS:

CONTENT:
	A 10 percentage
	point reduction in the Australian government's maximum crude
	oil levy on old oil would stabilize Bass Straits oil output,
	resources analyst Ian Story said here.
	    A reduction to 70 pct from 80 pct would enable Bass Strait
	output to be maintained at the current rate of 420,000 barrels
	per day (BPD) for the next year rather than falling to 380,000
	BPD in 1987/88, he told the Australian Petroleum Exploration
	Association annual conference.
	    Story is an analyst with and a director of Sydney
	stockbroker Meares and Philips Ltd.
	    Windfall profits taxes on Bass Strait crude are no longer
	appropriate in the current economic climate, Story said.
	    The maximum 80 pct levy on old oil -- that discovered
	before September 1975 -- is now forcing the Broken Hill Pty Co
	Ltd <BRKN.S>/Exxon Corp <XON> partnership to shut-in
	production, accelerating the decline in output and reducing
	government revenue, he said.
	    He said the producer return per barrel at a price of 30
	Australian dlrs a barrel would rise to 2.07 dlrs from 0.80 dlrs
	if the levy was cut to 70 pct.
	    "The economics at an 80 pct levy are simply not attractive
	at oil prices below 30 dlrs," Story said.
	    Cutting the maximum levy rate to 70 pct would create higher
	levels of self-sufficiency, increase government revenue, boost
	exports and provide incentives for exploration and development,
	he said.

	DUTCH PLANNING AGENCY FORECASTS LOWER GROWTH
TOPICS:

CONTENT:
	Dutch economic growth is slowing as a
	firming guilder cuts competitiveness abroad and industries
	reduce the pace of investment, the Dutch official planning
	agency CPB said.
	    The Centraal Planbureau, publishing its 1987 economic
	outlook, said Dutch Net National Income (NNI) was expected to
	grow by one pct this year, down from two pct growth recorded in
	1986 and 2.5 pct in 1985 and 1984.
	    Dutch Gross National Product is expected to rise to 432.20
	billion guilders in 1987 in constant prices, a two pct increase
	from last year's 423.95 billion.
	    The CPB, forecasting an 8.5 pct increase in the value of
	the guilder on a trade-weighted basis compared with 10.0 pct
	last year, said the dollar was expected to trade at an average
	of 2.0 guilders in 1987 compared with 2.45 guilders in 1986.
	    "The higher guilder is causing a substantial fall in unit
	labour costs abroad, when measured in guilder terms, while
	these are rising slightly in the Netherlands," the CPB said.
	    More of economic growth now depended on domestic
	consumption, the CPB said, but noting that higher margins set
	by domestic producers and importers mitigated the effect on
	purchasing power of lower import costs and deflation.
	    Consumer prices were set to fall by 1.5 pct this year, the
	CPB said. Inflation was zero last year.
	    Gross investment in industry was expected to grow by five
	pct this year, a slowdown compared with 11.5 pct growth last
	year, the CPB said.
	    Exchange rate and oil price fluctuations will continue to
	condition the Dutch economy in the future as it has in recent
	years, the CPB said, noting a continued depressing impact of
	these factors on Dutch competitiveness.
	    In addition, it noted a slight rise in taxation and social
	security costs to employers.
	    The CPB, forecasting a rise in the budget deficit to 7.2
	pct of Net National Income in 1987 from 6.3 pct last year,
	urged the government to cut expenditure further to bring down
	the deficit and reduce tax and social security payments in
	future.
	    Dutch government revenue is being depressed further by
	falling income from natural gas sales in 1987, the CPB said.
	    It said unemployment was expected to fall to 675,000 this
	year from 710,000 last year.
	    While the two pct GDP growth forecast set by the CPB is
	within its latest forecast, issued last month, of 1.5 to two
	pct growth, the figure is well above recent market estimates.
	    Dutch merchant bank Pierson, Heldring en Pierson said in
	its February economic outlook that GDP growth at constant
	prices was expected to be 1.1 pct this year and market analysts
	had expected the CPB's final forecast to be below its own
	latest estimate.
	    "It is too early to comment because I haven't seen the whole
	document yet, but it would seem we are more pessimistic in some
	of our estimates," a Pierson economist said.
	    The CPB forecast 2.5 pct export growth in volume terms in
	1987, after four pct growth last year. Excluding energy
	exports, the 1987 figure would be two pct, it said.
	    Imports were set to rise by 4.5 pct this year compared with
	four pct in 1986 in volume terms, the CPB said.
	    The balance of payments would see a sharp decline in the
	surplus, to six billion guilders in 1987 compared with 12.1
	billion last year, the CPB forecast.

	    Spending on defence and foreign affairs, traditionally
	combined, will be 175.92 billion dlrs against 160.33 billion.
	    Social affairs will receive 85.37 billion dlrs against
	71.76 billion. Economic construction and communications will
	receive 82.68 billion against 85.49 billion, and education
	62.21 billion compared with 54.34 billion.

	    The 1987/88 deficit will be covered by the issue of
	government bonds worth 59.5 billion dlrs and a budget surplus
	of 13.54 billion from the current year.
	    The cabinet allocated 16.92 billion dlrs to cover a 10 pct

	The Thai Cabinet approved a seven pct
	increase in the national budget for fiscal 1987/88 starting
	next October, compared with a 6.2 pct increase for the current

	    He told reporters the budget, to be presented to Parliament
	by late next month or in early June, calls for spending of
	243.5 billion baht against 227.5 billion this year.
	    The new budget is intended to make Thailand's Gross

	without compromising its conservative fiscal and monetary
	policy, the spokesman said.
	    "The budget is in line with our policy to stimulate the
	economy and to achieve a stable growth while we continue
	maintaining our current cautious fiscal policy," he said.
	    The spokesman said the budget provides for a 9.6 pct

	billion baht, up from 36.3 billion this year.
	    Government revenue is projected to grow 7.5 pct to 199.5

	    He said the budget contains a 44 billion baht deficit, or
	about 3.4 pct of GDP, compared with 42 billion or 3.5 pct
	planned for this year.  The deficit is required by Thai laws to
	be financed by domestic borrowings.

	Sudan has set aside 781.6 mln dlrs to
	service foreign debts in 1987/88, according to budget plans
	presented to parliament.
	    This compares with 200 mln dlrs earmarked for debt
	repayment in the year ending June 30. Sudan has a foreign debt
	totalling 10.6 billion dlrs.
	    Finance Minister Beshir Omar, presenting plans to
	parliament last night, put the budget deficit at 2.88 billion
	pounds, against 2.85 billion in 1986/87.
	    He said the budget would be the first in a four-year
	economic recovery plan to be announced by the end of December.
	    Of the total set aside for debt servicing, Omar said 574.6
	mln dlrs would go to principal and 207 mln to interest
	payments.
	    Sudan has an annual debt liability of 900 mln dlrs,
	Khartoum-based Western experts say.
	    Omar said last March it would be difficult, "if not
	impossible," for Sudan to meet scheduled debt repayments of 4.17
	billion dlrs over the next five years.
	    He said last night Sudan was 2.6 billion dlrs in arrears on
	debt repayments in the first half of this year.
	    The experts say Sudan owes 23 pct of its foreign debt to
	Western government creditors, 32 pct to governments of Eastern
	bloc and Arab countries and 21 pct to commercial banks, with
	most of the rest owed to multilateral sources.
	    Sudan, unable to fully service its debts since 1985 and
	declared ineligible last year by the International Monetary
	Fund for fresh loans, has been servicing only creditors banned
	from extending fresh loans to recipients in arrears.
	    Omar said government revenue in 1987/88 would total 3.9
	billion pounds. Expenditure was put at 6.79 billion pounds.
	    He said the budget deficit would be fully covered by loans,
	government deposits and other sources.
	    Omar said 375 mln pounds would be spent on subsidising
	sugar and wheat flour prices in 1987/88.
	    He said some of Sudan's Western backers were witholding aid
	until an agreement with the IMF was reached.
	    Sudan, which owes the IMF 450 to 500 mln dlrs in arrears,
	is scheduled to hold fresh talks with the Fund in late July or
	August on reforming its economy and clearing arrears.

CONTENT:
	The Ugandan government, in its four
	year investment and development plan, proposed taxing land and
	food crops in an attempt to broaden its revenue base away from
	dependence on coffee sales.
	    The government also said in the plan, made available to
	Reuters, that a devaluation of the Ugandan shilling would do
	little to redress a chronic balance of payments deficit.
	    The plan, the first since President Yoweri Museveni took
	power 15 months ago, seeks to raise 2.4 billion dlrs in
	investment funds from abroad between 1987 and 1991.
	    It says the government had already secured 1.4 billion dlrs
	in pledges before Islamic lenders promised a further 494 mln
	dlrs at a conference in Kampala last week.
	    Uganda already had an external debt of 984 mln dlrs at the
	end of 1986 and in the nine months of the current budget debt
	servicing will cost 204 mln dlrs, almost 50 pct of export
	earnings of 431 mln, the plan said.
	    The new fiscal measures include a proposed tax on large
	land holdings, regardless of whether the owners are exploiting
	them, and taxes on maize, beans and other crops sold by the
	Produce Marketing Board.
	    The plan says the aim is to spread the tax burden, which in
	Uganda has traditionally fallen almost exclusively on coffee
	farmers. Coffee provides over 90 pct of foreign exchange
	earnings and more than 70 pct of government revenue.
	    On exchange rate policy, it repeats Museveni's argument
	that any form of fotation would not help allocating resources.
	    Western governments and multilateral funds say the Ugandan
	shilling is grossly overvalued and the government must change
	the exchange rate if it wishes to encourage investment. The
	shilling sells on the black market at more than 15,000 to the
	dollar, compared with an official rate of 1,400.

	GERMAN BOURSE TURNOVER TAX DECISION ANGERS BANKS

	The failure of the West German government
	to abolish a tax on bourse turnover when other taxes came under
	discussion during recent coalition negotiations was a "bitter
	disappointment," the president of the West German Federation of
	Banks, Hanns Christian Schroeder-Hohenwarth, said.
	    Schroeder-Hohenwarth told a news conference that, contrary
	to numerous assurances from the government, the abolition of
	the turnover tax had not been touched upon.
	    "This must not be allowed to be the last word. Otherwise a
	major chance for West Germany as a financial centre will have
	been missed," he said.
	    After the January 25 election the government decided upon a
	reform of the West German tax system, involving gross tax cuts
	of 44 billion marks, which would be implemented in 1990.
	    In line with a pledge made by Bonn at the February monetary
	conference in Paris, the government said earlier this month
	part of the planned tax cuts would be effective next year.
	    Government sources have said the fact the latest coalition
	discussions did not touch upon the bourse turnover tax does not
	necessarily rule out the possibility that it could be abolished
	later in the current four-year legislative period.
	    The bourse turnover tax, levied on securities trades where
	an end-investor is involved, generated government revenue of
	some 750 mln marks in 1986, according to the Finance Ministry.
	    Schroeder-Hohenwarth said there were no fiscal reasons for
	maintaining the tax because companies would benefit from its
	abolition. Their earnings would increase and the government
	would receive more in profits tax.
	    Wolfgang Roeller, chief executive of Dresdner Bank AG, said
	the bourse tax decision did not fit into the general background
	of liberalisation of the German capital market, and represented
	a weakening of West Germany as a financial centre.

	deficit of 5.472 billion riyals.
	    The deficit compared with a shortfall of 7.3 billion riyals
	in the last published budget for 1985/86.
	    In a statement outlining the budget for the fiscal year
	1987/88 beginning today, Finance and Petroleum Minister Sheikh
	Abdul-Aziz bin Khalifa al-Thani said the government expected to
	spend 12.217 billion riyals in the period.
	    Projected expenditure in the 1985/86 budget had been 15.6
	billion riyals.
	    Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said government revenue would be about
	6.745 billion riyals, down by about 30 pct on the 1985/86
	projected revenue of 9.7 billion.
	    The government failed to publish a 1986/87 budget due to
	uncertainty surrounding oil revenues.
	    Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said that during that year the government
	decided to limit recurrent expenditure each month to
	one-twelfth of the previous fiscal year's allocations minus 15
	pct.
	    He urged heads of government departments and public
	institutions to help the government rationalise expenditure. He
	did not say how the 1987/88 budget shortfall would be covered.
	    Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said plans to limit expenditure in
	1986/87 had been taken in order to relieve the burden placed on
	the country's foreign reserves.
	    He added in 1987/88 some 2.766 billion riyals had been
	allocated for major projects including housing and public
	buildings, social services, health, education, transport and
	communications, electricity and water, industry and
	agriculture.
	    No figure was revealed for expenditure on defence and
	security. There was also no projection for oil revenue.
	    Qatar, an OPEC member, has an output ceiling of 285,000
	barrels per day.
	    Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said: "Our expectations of positive signs
	regarding (oil) price trends, foremost among them OPEC's
	determination to shoulder its responsibilites and protect its
	wealth, have helped us make reasonable estimates for the coming
	year's revenue on the basis of our assigned quota."
