	RECENT SUGAR FALL SPARKS SOVIET, CHINESE BUYING
TOPICS:
	sugar
PLACES:
	uk, ussr, china, cuba
CONTENT:
	The recent fall in world sugar prices,
	due to increased producer pricing sales and evidence of export
	availability, has encouraged renewed buying interest from China
	and the Soviet Union, London trade house E.D.And F. Man said.
	    Further purchases are expected by the Peoples Republic of
	China at the lower end of the recent price range, which should
	limit the downside movement, it said in its latest monthly
	market report.
	   "And it is believed that the Soviet Union will need to return
	to the market to take a further 250,000/350,000 tonnes for
	May/June shipment, Man added.
	    The Soviets purchased five cargoes of raws for April/May
	shipment towards the end of last month, which brings its total
	purchases to around 1.65 mln tonnes, Man said.
	    Production estimates for the Thai crop now exceed 2.3 mln
	tonnes and the final outturn appears set to reach around 2.5
	mln tonnes. However, this upturn in the Thai crop is being
	countered by a reduction in China's production forecast to 5.3
	mln tonnes from 5.5 mln estimated earlier.
	    Market participation by Cuba suggests that its crop could
	be close to last year's 7.3 mln tonnes. But even with similar
	production Man expects Cuban exports to be significantly down.
	    Cuba was reported to be carrying 1.3 mln tonnes of stocks
	in September 1985, of which some 440,000 tonnes were used to
	boost its 1985/86 exports to about 6.9 mln. But as it will not
	be able to draw on surplus stocks this year, Man estimates
	Cuba's export availabilty will be reduced to 6.4 to 6.5 mln
	tonnes.
	    However, Cuba is only one of a large number of exporters
	with reduced availability, Man said.
	    Since 1980 the total free market export supply has fallen
	to 18 mln from about 22 mln tonnes. But at the same time free
	market demand has also fallen by almost the same amount, which
	has left exporters chasing falling import requirements.
	    A fairly tight balance now appears to have emerged. But the
	difficult task of keeping production advances at bay still
	remains, as at least one more season of production deficit is
	needed to eliminate some of the remaining surplus stocks still
	overhanging the market, Man said.
	    The increasing cases of record production as a result of
	record yields and better husbandry have forced sugar producers
	to strive for greater efficiency.
	    As this increase in efficiency reduces the marginal cost of
	production, sugar exporters may become more responsive to
	prices and in particular to upward price movements, Man said.
	    Commenting on the current row between the EC Commission and
	sugar producers, Man said despite the recent improvement in the
	level of restitutions, they are still insufficient to fully
	compensate producers when exporting on the world market.
	    Unless there are further improvements, at least some sugar
	is expected to remain in intervention, it added.

	DROUGHT CUTS CHINESE WHEAT CROP -- USDA REPORT

	Drought has resulted in a reduction
	in China's estimated wheat crop this year to 87.0 mln tonnes,
	2.0 mln below last year's harvest, the U.S. Agriculture
	Department's officer in Peking said in a field report.
	    The report, dated March 25, said imports in the 1987/88
	season are projected at 8.0 mln tonnes, 1.0 mln tonnes above
	the the current season's estimate.
	    Imports from the United States are estimated at 1.5 mln
	tonnes compared to only 150,000 tonnes estimated for the
	1986/87 year, it said.
	    After travelling to major wheat producing areas and
	obtaining more information on the planted area, the total
	planted area was estimated down 290,000 hectares due to the dry
	fall, it said.
	    The report said to compensate for the below normal
	precipitation irrigation has increased as has the use of
	fertilizer.
	    While there are pockets where irrigation is not possible,
	most of the wheat crop has access to some water and therefore
	has emerged from dormancy and is doing well, the report said.
	    It said scattered rain in many parts of China in the past
	10 days has improved the situation but information on hail
	damage in Anhui is incomplete.

CONTENT:
	Three geographically diverse droughts
	in Asia are being linked by some scientists to a
	reintensification of the complex and little-understood El Nino
	weather pattern, <Accu-Weather Inc>, a commercial weather
	forecasting service, said.
	    Rice and wheat farmers in China, wheat and sugarcane
	growers in Australia and tea planters in Sri Lanka all face
	serious losses to their respective harvests unless rains arrive
	in time to break the droughts, offical reports, government
	officials and meteorologists said.
	    Wen Wei Po, a Hong Kong daily with close Peking links, said
	the drought is the worst in over 20 years and some provinces
	have been without adequate rainfall for more than seven months.
	    Rice planting is threatened in eight provinces, it added.
	    Rainfall in the key farming provinces of Henan and Sichuan
	was 70 pct below average during February, the lowest figure for
	over 20 years, the paper said.
	    The dry weather has cut stored water volumes by over 20 pct
	compared with last March and lowered the water levels of many
	rivers, it added.
	    This has resulted in reduced hydro-electric power, causing
	shortages to industry and households. The upper reaches of the
	Yangtze are at their lowest levels in a century, causing many
	ships to run aground, Wen Wei Po said.
	    Unusually high temperatures have also been reported across
	China, media reports said. The People's Daily said Sichuan has
	recorded temperatures three degrees Celsius higher than average
	since early February.
	    The New China News Agency said the average December
	temperature in Harbin in the northeast was six degrees higher
	than last December and 14 degrees higher than December 1984.
	    Severe drought is affecting about one-third of Sri Lanka
	and threatens to reduce the country's tea crop, Ministry of
	Plantation Industries officials told Reuters
	    In Australia, concern is growing about below-average
	rainfall levels in parts of the sugarcane belt along the
	Queensland coast and in Western Australia's wheat belt, local
	Meteorological Bureau officials said.
	    For many farmers and government officials the fear is that
	while the present low rainfall does not yet pose a major
	threat, the prospect of a dry autumn/winter season when the
	wheat crop is in its early stages certainly does, they added.
	    Concern is heightened by the memory of the 1982/83 drought
	which devastated the wheat crop and coincided with the
	occurrence of the barely understood weather phenomenon known as
	El Nino, they said.
	    Although meteorologists are cautious about linking the
	Asia-Pacific region's disrupted weather patterns to any single
	cause, El Nino's role is being closely studied, they said.
	    Accu-Weather Inc, which specialises in providing data for
	agriculture and shipping interests, said each El Nino 'event'
	was unique.
	    The El Nino does not always produce the same effects and
	the present occurrence is much less pronounced than the last
	major event in 1982/83, it said.
	    El Nino, Spanish for "Christ Child" because it appears around
	Christmas, is formed by the action of warm air, bearing clouds
	and rain, shifting from the Indonesian archipelago to the coast
	of Peru, where it mingles with the cold waters associated with
	the Peru current and returns across the Pacific as the trade
	winds, meteorologists said.
	    The winds, strengthened by El Nino's "pump" effect, raise the
	sea level off Australia and Indonesia, they said.
	    When the winds drop, the ocean, seeking equilibrium, sends
	a surge of warmer water back across the Pacific where it
	collides with the cold seas off Peru, they said.
	    One effect of this heat exchange is to deflect the
	rain-bearing clouds away from Australia and Indonesia into the
	Pacific, where they further disrupt other weather patterns.
	    The prospects for an end to the droughts vary, Accu-Weather
	said.
	    China, where the affected areas have received between 40
	and 75 pct of normal rainfall, will have to wait for the
	May-September rains, it said.
	    The May-September rains normally provide the
	drought-striken areas with 80 pct of annual rainfall.
	    In Australia, areas of Queensland's coastal strip have
	received less than half the normal rainfall during the current
	wet season, but prospects for increased rains are diminishing
	as the rainy season draws to an end.
	    In Sri Lanka, the drought has come when rainfall should be
	at its maximum for the year. The year's secondary rains usually
	occur between April and June, although it is not possible at
	this stage to forecast whether they will arrive as usual.

	major staple crops including maize, rice and cassava.
	    GNA quoted Botchwey as saying that while the consequences

	ANALYST SAYS USSR WINTER GRAINS HURT BY WEATHER
TOPICS:
	grain, wheat, corn
PLACES:
	usa, ussr, canada, australia, argentina
CONTENT:
	The Soviet Union's winter grain
	crop is likely to have suffered losses due to dry planting
	conditions last fall and severe cold this winter, an analyst of
	world weather and crop conditions said.
	    Grain analyst and meteorologist Gail Martell, author of the
	EF Hutton publication "Global Crop News," said in her latest
	report that the Soviets may import more grain, possibly wheat,
	from the U.S. due to potential crop damage.
	    "Compared with last year, the outlook (for the Soviet
	winter grain crop) is far more pessimistic," she said. "But
	it's still too early to talk about disastrous losses. A lot
	will depend on spring weather, not only for the outcome of the
	troubled winter grain crop, but also for spring planting."
	    Martell said the dry weather conditions last fall probably
	prevented optimal seed germination for winter grains. Key wheat
	growing areas of the southern Ukraine and North Caucasus
	received on 25-35 pct of autumn precipitation, she said.
	    The bitter winter cold temperatures -- which broke record
	lows that had stood for four decades -- also may have taken its
	toll on Soviet winter crops, she said.
	    However, she noted that most of the southern grain belt had
	ample snow cover, which should have well-insulated the majority
	of crop areas from severe frost damage.
	    The USSR has already bought 20 to 21 mln tonnes of grains
	in the July 1986/June 1987 marketing year, primarily from
	Canada, the European Community, Argentina and Australia,
	Martell said.
	    She cited a number of reasons besides possible crop
	problems that might point to additional Soviet import demand.
	    Last fall's dry weather may limit livestock grazing on
	moisture-depleted pastures, while the cold winter weather
	necessitated supplemental feeding to keep livestock healthy.
	    Martell was also skeptical of a Soviet claim for a 1986
	grain harvest of 210 mln tonnes, and said the Chernobyl
	accident may have contaminated more grain than originally
	thought and have to be made up with imports.
	    However, she said the U.S. remains a supplier of last
	resort for the Soviet Union, noting that the Soviets have only
	just recently begun their first U.S. grain purchases of the
	1986/87 season by buying 2.25 mln tonnes of corn.
	    Martell cited USDA statistics showing that since the 1980
	grain embargo the U.S. is only a major supplier of grain to the
	USSR during years of heavy Soviet demand.
	    In 1984/85, the U.S. supplied 41 pct of record Soviet grain
	imports of 55.5 mln tonnes. But in 1985/86, the Soviet Union
	bought 29.9 mln tonnes of grain and turned to the U.S. for only
	24 pct of that total.
	    While the USDA Soviet import target for grain for 1986/87
	was 22 mln tonnes, many U.S. grain analysts have revised their
	estimates of Soviet imports up to 25-28 mln tonnes, she said.

	SOVIET GRAINS SEEN ENTERING SPRING ON SHAKY NOTE
TOPICS:

PLACES:

CONTENT:
	Soviet winter grains could be off to
	a faulty start this spring after enduring an usually dry fall
	and cold winter, weather and crop analysts said.
	    Prospects for another near-record grain harvest in the
	Soviet Union appear dim at this point, but it is premature to
	forecast any major crop problems, analysts said.
	    But the situation bears careful watching over the next six
	weeks and will ultimately impact the Soviet grain supply and
	future buying plans, analysts of the Soviet Union said.
	    "From a weather standpoint, you can say with certainty that
	the Soviets are not getting off to a good start and will have a
	lower crop (than last year)," Gail Martell, chief meteorologist
	for E.F. Hutton said.
	    The next six weeks in the USSR's grain growing areas will
	be the crucial period that will determine the final outcome of
	the winter crops, Martell and other analysts said.
	    "Where the crop is really made or broken is still ahead of
	us," an Agriculture Department authority on the USSR said.
	    The Soviet Union recently reported that nine mln hectares
	of winter grain will have to be reseeded due to winterkill.
	This would be equal to about 25 pct of the total winter crop
	and would be the second highest winterkill in ten years, the
	USDA analyst said.
	    With a timely spring, Soviet farmers would probably be able
	to reseed the damaged acreage with spring crops, but analysts
	noted that spring crops normally yield lower than winter crops
	-- sometimes as much as 30-35 pct lower.
	    Normally winterkill is caused by inadequate snowcover
	combined with cold temperatures. This winter, however,
	snowcover in Soviet grain areas has generally been excellent,
	so the bulk of winterkill, analysts speculate, likely has been
	due to a very dry fall and subsequent poor crop germination.
	    "Fall dryness may be a problem. There's a good correlation
	between mediocre crops and fall dryness," Martell said.
	    Precipitation last fall was as little as 25 pct of normal
	in southern and northern Ukraine, and below normal over the
	entire winter crop area, she said.
	    Recent cold temperatures in grain areas in which the
	snowcover has been gradually melting could also have caused 
	problems of ice-crusting and winterkill, Jim Candor, senior
	forecaster for Accu Weather, said.
	    Livestock feed needs have probably increased because of the
	fall and winter, analysts said. The dry fall damaged pastures,
	the cold winter raised feed demands and a late spring would
	require longer off-pasture feeding, they said.
	    "The Soviets are not in a desperate situation ... they
	don't have to buy (grains) now," a USDA official said.
	    But if the Soviets are worried about their winter crops and
	if they feel that last year's huge crop of 210 mln tonnes was a
	one-time fluke brought on by perfect conditions, more Soviet
	buying might occur to insure crop supplies, he said.
	    Bad weather during the next six weeks could push the
	Soviets back into the market, weather analysts said.
	    "A lot of winterkill could occur during the next month and
	a half," Martell said.
