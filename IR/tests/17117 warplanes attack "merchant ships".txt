	IRAQ SAYS IT HIT TWO SHIPS IN GULF, DOWNS IRAN F-4
TOPICS:
	ship
PLACES:
	iraq, iran
CONTENT:
	Iraq said its warplanes attacked two
	large naval targets -- Baghdad's usual term for oil tankers or
	merchant ships -- in the Gulf today.
	    A military spokesman said the planes scored accurate and
	effective hits in both attacks.
	    There was no immediate confirmation of the raids from
	independent shipping sources in the region.
	    The spokesman said during one of the attacks, Iraqi planes
	intercepted an Iranian F-4 Phantom and shot it down. All Iraqi
	warplanes returned safely to base, he added.

	IRAN SAYS IT INTENDS NO THREAT TO GULF SHIPPING

CONTENT:
	Iran said reports that it intended to
	threaten shipping in the Gulf were baseless, and warned the
	U.S. And other countries not to interfere in the region.
	    Tehran radio, monitored by the BBC, quoted a Foreign
	Ministry spokesman as saying any attempt at interference would
	be met by "a strong response from Iran and other Moslems in the
	world."
	     U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger, in remarks
	apparently unrelated to the broadcast, said the U.S. Would do
	whatever was necessary to keep shipping lanes open in the face
	of new Iranian anti-ship missiles in the Gulf.
	    The U.S. State Department said two days ago Tehran had been
	told of U.S. Concern that Iranian anti-ship missiles posed a
	threat to the free flow of oil from the Gulf.
	    U.S. Officials have said Iran has new Chinese-made
	anti-ship "Silkworm" missiles, which pose a greater threat to
	merchant ships than missiles used before.
	    The Iranian spokesman said the reports that Iran intended
	to attack ships were "misleading propaganda."
	    He said Iraq's President Saddam Hussein was the main cause
	of tension in the Gulf and said Iran would continue to use "all
	its legitimate means to stem the cause of tension."
	    Weinberger said in a television interview in the U.S. "We
	are fully prepared to do what's necessary to keep the shipping
	going and keep the freedom of navigation available in that very
	vital waterway."
	    "We aren't going into any disclosures or discussions of what
	might happen, but we are certainly very sympathetic to and
	listening carefully to any suggestions for our assistance in
	keeping navigation free in that area," he said.
	    Weinberger said U.S warship movements in the Gulf area were
	not unusual.
	    A U.S. Navy battle group led by the aircraft carrier Kitty
	Hawk is currently in the northern Arabian Sea.
	    The Iranian spokesman was quoted by Tehran radio as saying
	the U.S. Was trying to build up its military presence in the
	region.

	CHANCES OF DIRECT U.S.-IRAN GULF CLASH SEEN LOW
TOPICS:
	ship, crude
PLACES:
	kuwait, usa, iran
CONTENT:
	U.S. moves to increase its warships in
	and around the Mideast Gulf could trigger more attacks on
	unprotected merchant ships but run little risk of sparking a
	direct military clash with Iran, diplomats said.
	    They said the American decision inevitably carries some
	risk of armed confrontation, but Iran -- despite its blunt
	rhetoric -- would want to avoid this as much as Washington.
	    "As Iran knows very well, what America is bringing into the
	Gulf could do serious damage," said one western diplomat.
	    Diplomats see the greatest potential danger in more attacks
	on "soft targets" such as merchant shipping not protected by
	American or other western navy vessels patrolling the Gulf.
	    The risk of Iranian attack on U.S. Warships or Kuwaiti oil
	tankers carrying the U.S. Flag and under naval escort is rated
	by diplomats as low. However, "There is the threat that the
	Iranians, seeing these heavily protected U.S.-flag tankers,
	will go for softer targets," one diplomat said.
	    Tehran Radio quoted Iran's top defence spokesman Ali Akbar
	Hashemi Rafsanjani as saying yesterday that Washington was
	"moving to the brink of an armed encounter with us."
	    The U.S. is increasing its Gulf fleet from seven to 10
	warships and sending the refurbished battleship Missouri to
	patrol just outside the Strait of Hormuz.
	    The build-up ties in with U.S. plans to start escorting
	Kuwaiti oil tankers next month, which have been re-registered
	to fly the American flag to give them naval protection.
	    Shipping serving Kuwait has come under repeated attack by
	Iran, angered at the emirate's war backing of Iraq.
	    Concern in the region has mounted over the threat posed by
	Chinese-made Silkworm missiles, which the U.S. says Iran is
	preparing to deploy near the Strait of Hormuz.
	    The Missouri, with its four-escort flotilla, is likely to
	make Iran think twice about using the missiles, diplomats said.
	    A military source in the Gulf has said Iran also set up a
	launching site for the Silkworms on captured Iraqi soil in the
	Faw peninsula, within range of Kuwait.
	    "But anything that went as far as a direct attack on Kuwaiti
	territory would be a very serious escalation" likely moving
	world opinion against Iran, remarked one.
	    Some diplomats believe Iran could also consider carrying
	out reprisals against the United States outside the Gulf.
	    Rafsanjani, who is also parliamentary leader, predicted
	last Friday "a river of blood" throughout the world in the event
	of any U.S. strike against Iran.
	    Western diplomats said Iran, which Washington has accused
	of being behind state-sponsored terrorism, had no demonstrable
	capacity to carry out attacks in the U.S. itself.
	    Diplomats saw few potential targets in Lebanon now that
	most Americans have left in the wake of kidnappings linked to
	pro-Iranian groups. But Europe and Asia were potential
	trouble-spots, and Kuwait was one of the most obvious targets.
	    Any backlash was likely to take the form of sabotage or
	other action to make it difficult to blame Iran, they added.

	EC WATCHING GULF WAR DEVELOPMENTS
TOPICS:
	crude, ship
PLACES:
	luxembourg
CONTENT:
	The European Community (EC) should
	watch very carefully for any developments in the Gulf War and
	their consequences on the oil market, EC Energy Commissioner
	Nicolas Mosar said today.
	    Speaking two weeks after a U.S. warship was attacked in the
	Gulf, Mosar warned, "An escalation in the Gulf would increase
	tensions in the oil market."
	    "But I do not want to be alarmist," he told a news conference
	after an EC energy ministers meeting in Luxembourg.
	    He said the volume of EC oil imports from the Gulf had
	declined to around 31 pct of total oil imports in the first
	three months of 1987 against 35 pct in the same period last
	year. "There are also other potential sources of supplies in the
	world," he added.
	    The issue of Gulf oil imports was not discussed at the
	ministers' meeting, he added.
	    A EC committee of national experts in the so-called oil
	supply group would discuss Gulf oil supplies at their bi-annual
	meeting on June 19, he said.
	    But any major decisions would have to be reserved for EC
	foreign ministers, diplomats said.
	    West European nations have so far shown little enthusiasm
	for backing a U.S. plan to give military protection to merchant
	ships in the Gulf which could help insure the safety of oil
	supplies.
