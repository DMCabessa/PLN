	Japan was ready to use diplomacy to help
	maintain the security of the Gulf, Prime Minister Yasuhiro
	Nakasone said.
	    But he told reporters Japan should not cut its lines of
	communication with Iran and Iraq because its policy was to take
	a broad political stance. Officials of the foreign ministry
	said Japan had maintained good relations with both Iran and
	Iraq, which have been at war since September 1980.
	    Last week Nakasone ruled out Japanese military or financial
	help to patrol the waters of the Gulf. About 60 pct of Japan's
	crude oil passes through the waterway.
	    President Reagan said yesterday the threat to oil routes in
	the Gulf from attacks by Iran and Iraq was high on the agenda
	for next week's G-7 summit in Venice.
	    Reagan has approved plans for the United States to step up
	its naval presence in the Gulf despite congressional
	expressions of concern and he has called on U.S. Allies to help
	maintain freedom of navigation.
	    Japan's constitution prevents its armed forces from being
	deployed overseas. Nakasone has said that Washington
	understands this problem.

	NIPPON MINING PLANS MORE U.S. JOINT VENTURES
TOPICS:

CONTENT:
	Nippon Mining Co Ltd president Yukio
	Kasahara said the state-owned Japanese firm hoped to find
	additional joint venture partners to explore for U.S. oil
	reserves.
	    "We have to secure the stability of oil for Japan,"
	Kasahara told reporters at the World Petroleum Congress. "In
	the exploration area I think Japanese companies are interested
	in joint ventures."
	    Nippon Mining, for example, last September signed an
	agreement with Dupont Co's <DD> Conoco Inc to participate in a
	135 mln dlr exploration venture that includes six wells on land
	and 14 offshore Louisiana. The first joint well drilled is in
	the Gulf of Mexico's Green Canyon Block 182, a deepwater lease
	that Conoco was almost forced to return to the federal
	government undrilled because of low oil prices.
	    "At this moment we have no success but we will proceed with
	Conoco. Maybe by the end of the year we will find oil there,"
	Kasahara said. He said that similar kinds of joint ventures
	"would be best" for Nippon Mining's oil exploration efforts in
	the future.
	    Kasahara also said Nippon Mining was not planning to
	acquire any U.S. refining or marketing outlets. "Retail sales
	in general do not interest the Japanese oil companies," he
	said.
	    When asked whether he believed world oil prices might
	strengthen later this year, Kasahara said he expected prices to
	hold steady at today's level.
	    "Within this year I think the 18 dlrs a barrel will
	continue. But next year I don't know," he said. "For the
	refining business, stability is important. Whether the price is
	18 dlrs or 20 dlrs, we don't care."
	    But encouraging additional upstream efforts may require
	modestly higher oil prices, Kasahara added. "For exploration I
	think 20 dlrs a barrel or 22 dlrs a barrel would be
	reasonable," he said.
	    The key factor in determining whether the Organization of
	Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would raise its 18 dlr a
	barrel benchmark price is the ongoing war between Iran and
	Iraq, Kasahara said. Saudi Arabia, he added, was an uncertain
	element in the OPEC equation because of its need to maintain
	revenues at the same time the weakened U.S. dollar has reduced
	oil profits.
	    Nippon Mining, which like all Japanese crude buyers is
	benefitting from the drop in the value of the dollar, favors
	continuing to price OPEC crude oil according to U.S. currency
	regardless of the dollar-yen relationship, Kasahara said.
	    "I hope the dollar would strengthen eventually and continue
	to improve. I would prefer to see the (OPEC) pricing remain in
	dollars," he said.

	SAUDI TO REMAIN AS KEY LPG SUPPLIER TO JAPAN
TOPICS:
	propane, ship
PLACES:
	iraq, iran, japan, saudi-arabia
CONTENT:
	Saudi Arabia is likely to remain the key
	supplier of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to Japan for at least
	the next five years, oil industry sources said.
	    Japan, while diversifying its supply sources of propane and
	butane for stable supplies, will continue to bank on Saudi
	Arabian LPG, the sources said.
	    They said Saudi's supply capabilities of LPG, an associate
	of crude oil, is guaranteed by its crude output capacity. "Saudi
	is a reliable supplier in that sense," said one trader.
	    Japan imports about 50 pct of its LPG from Saudi Arabia.
	    No single nation could substitute for Saudi Arabia as an
	LPG supply source to Japan, the sources said.
	    "Saudi Arabia has committed itself to Japanese LPG buyers,
	which has quelled fears that LPG supplies from the Mideast Gulf
	could easily be disrupted in the wake of heightened hostilities
	in that area," said another trader.
	    Saudi Arabia cut LPG shipments to Japan and elsewhere by 20
	pct in September after a fire put a major gas plant at
	Al-Juaimah out of operation. October shipments were back to
	contractual volumes as Saudi was able to boost exports from
	other ports.
	    Attacks on Gulf shipping by Iran and Iraq centered on crude
	rather than products carriers, which has lulled fears of LPG
	supply disruptions, traders said.
	    They said an Iranian blockade of the Strait of Hormuz was
	unlikely because it would block Iran's oil shipments.
	    Industry sources said Japan's LPG imports will not greatly
	rise or fall as its domestic demand growth is estimated at a
	moderate 2.1 pct a year from 1986 through 1991.
	    Japanese term buyers of Saudi LPG are expected to lift
	slightly lower volumes from January 1987, when imports from
	Indonesia are slated to increase, the sources said.
	    The customers are unlikely to slash Saudi term purchases in
	large scale when Japan increases annual imports of Indonesian
	LPG to 1.95 mln tonnes in early 1989 from 319,000 tonnes in the
	year ended March 1987, the sources said.
	    But when demand is sluggish in summer, they will phase down
	term purchases of Saudi LPG and secure lower-priced cargoes on
	the spot market, they said.
	    Japan imports some 12 mln tonnes of LPG a year, of which
	5.3 mln tonnes are supplied by Saudi Arabia, 3.3 mln under term
	contracts and two mln through spot purchases. Some 80 pct of
	Japan's LPG imports are from the Middle East.
	    Saudi Arabia's state owned oil company Petromin has made
	some concessions on term prices to Japanese customers in the
	recent round of contract renewal talks, and it is likely the
	Japanese will accept the offer, the sources said.
	    The Japanese term customers, however, have so far been
	unsuccessful in establishing a transparent price formula to
	replace the existing unilateral monthly price notice.
	    Japanese buyers pay Saudi Arabia a price notified by
	Petromin each month. Most recently the FOB price was set at 87
	pct of the 17.52 dlrs per barrel government selling price (GSP)
	of Arabian Light.
	    Buyers reserve the right to phase down or out liftings
	should the monthly price be set at over 95 pct of Arabian
	Light's GSP.
	    Petromin has offered to lower this rate to 90 pct from the
	95 pct for contracts with Japanese customers from next January,
	the trade sources said.
	    Petromin also suggested that a seller's option of supplying
	up to 20 pct more than the contractural volume be subject to
	seller-buyer agreement.
	    Under the present contract, Petromin can automatically cut
	supplies up to 10 pct of the contractual volume.
	    "If you want to import LPG from Saudi Arabia on a profitable
	basis, you have to set the price factor at 80 to 85 pct," said
	an official at a major importer. "Freight costs are higher for
	cargoes coming from the Gulf than Southeast Asia due to a
	longer haul and war risk insurance payments."
	    Japanese customers will visit Saudi Arabia this month to
	finalise their separate contract talks, now focusing on
	contractual period and volume, which could be very similar to
	current levels, the sources said. "When we talk business, we
	would seek profitability and sometimes forget vulnerability of
	high dependence on a single supplier," said one.

	U.S. OIL PRICES STRONG AHEAD OF OPEC MEETING
TOPICS:

CONTENT:
	U.S. crude oil prices are at their
	highest level in more than a year ahead of next week's OPEC
	meeting, even though most industry analysts do not expect any
	policy changes from the session.
	    They said prices, which have steadily climbed since the
	organization's accord in December, have risen on technical
	factors within the market and concerns about supplies because
	of the Iran-Iraq war, which could disrupt deliveries from the
	Gulf.
	    The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate is trading
	around 20.55 dlrs in the July contract on New York Mercantile
	Exchange's energy futures and in the spot market. That is its
	highest level since January 1986.
	    OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukman, who is Nigeria's
	oil minister, said Friday he expects the meeting in Vienna to
	be brief and calm and that OPEC's current price and production
	agreement may only need a slight review.
	    Although most industry experts expect just a reaffirmation
	of the December agreement, oil prices continue to climb due to
	a desire to hedge positions in case of any surprises.
	    Analysts expect the higher prices to continue until soon
	after the OPEC meeting. At that point, barring any increased
	tension in the Gulf or changes in OPEC's policies, prices
	should begin easing.
	    "OPEC will probably not do anything it hasn't already agreed
	to in December because oil prices are firm," said John Hill, a
	vice president at Merrill Lynch Futures.
	    OPEC agreed in December to maintain official oil prices at
	18 dlrs a barrel and raise the group's production ceiling to
	16.6 mln barrels per day in the third quarter and to 18.3 mln
	barrels in the fourth quarter.
	    This agreement helped send prices sharply higher, rising
	from 15 dlrs a barrel in early December.
	    Several OPEC members who are price hawks, including Iran,
	Algeria and Libya, will seek a higher official price and a
	reduction in output.
	    "And if U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude continues to
	trade above 20 dlrs a barrel, there is a greater chance that
	OPEC will raise its official 18 dlrs price," said Nauman
	Barakat, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co.
	    But most analysts expect the more moderate producers, such
	as Saudi Arabia, to block any changes in policy.
	    "The meeting will be a non-event with no change in the
	official prices because OPEC, and in particular the Saudis, are
	committed to stabilizing the market," said Rosario Ilacqua,
	analyst with L.F. Rothschild.
	    However, some analysts said OPEC may need to hold a meeting
	in September to re-evaluate market conditions.
	    Overproduction by OPEC will become a real problem in the
	fourth quarter when the quota is raised to 18.3 mln barrels a
	day and Iraq's pipeline through Turkey brings another 500,000
	barrels to the market each day, said John Lichtblau, president
	of Petroleum Industry Ressearch Foundation.
	    Most expect Saudi Arabia to oppose a price increase at this
	meeting but many look for an increase by year-end to 20 dlrs to
	offset the decline in the dollar. Oil prices are denominated
	throughout the world in dollars, so as the currency declines,
	producers receive less money for their oil.
	    "The only real production restraint in OPEC is Saudi Arabia,"
	said Sanford Margoshes, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers.
	    "In the second half of the year we expect the Saudis not to
	produce at their 4.1 mln barrel a day quota and therefore act
	as a vehicle to stablize the market and pave the way for a two
	dlrs a barrel price increase at the December 1987 meeting," he
	said.
	    One uncertain factor is the course of the Iran-Iraq war.
	    "The wild card is the increased tensions in the Persian
	Gulf," said Frank Knuettel, analyst with Prudential-Bache
	Securites.
	    Oil tankers taking oil from Iraq and Kuwait have been
	regular targets for Iranian planes. The Reagan administration
	is planning to put Kuwait tankers under the protection of the
	U.S. flag, with naval escorts.
	    "Extra (oil) inventories are needed during a time of crisis
	like this, and just general nervousness over an incident that
	could disrupt oil supplies drives prices up," Knuettel said.

	beacons -- usually lit up like Christmas trees at night.
	    One of them, sitting astride the Rostam offshore oilfield,
	was all but blown out of the water by U.S. Warships on Monday.
	    The Iranian platform, an unsightly mass of steel and
	concrete, was a three-tier structure rising 200 feet (60
	metres) above the warm waters of the Gulf until four U.S.
	Destroyers pumped some 1,000 shells into it.
	    The U.S. Defense Department said just 10 pct of one section
	of the structure remained.
	    U.S. helicopters destroyed three Iranian gunboats after an
	American helicopter came under fire earlier this month and U.S.
	forces attacked, seized, and sank an Iranian ship they said had
	been caught laying mines.
	    But Iran was not deterred, according to U.S. defense
	officials, who said Iranian forces used Chinese-made Silkworm
	missiles to hit a U.S.-owned Liberian-flagged ship on Thursday
	and the Sea Isle City on Friday.
	    Both ships were hit in the territorial waters of Kuwait, a
	key backer of Iraq in its war with Iran.
	    Henry Schuler, a former U.S. diplomat in the Middle East
	now with CSIS said Washington had agreed to escort Kuwaiti
	tankers in order to deter Iranian attacks on shipping.
	    But he said the deterrence policy had failed and the level
	of violence and threats to shipping had increased as a result
	of U.S. intervention and Iran's response.
	    The attack on the oil platform was the latest example of a
	U.S. "tit-for-tat" policy that gave Iran the initiative, said
	Harlan Ullman, an ex-career naval officer now with CSIS.
	    He said with this appraoch America would suffer "the death
	of one thousand cuts."
	    But for the United States to grab the initiative
	militarily, it must take warlike steps such as mining Iran's
	harbors or blockading the mouth of the Gulf through which its
	shipping must pass, Schuler said.
	    He was among those advocating mining as a means of bringing
	Iran to the neogtiating table. If vital supplies were cut off,
	Tehran could not continue the war with Iraq.
	    Ullman said Washington should join Moscow in a diplomatic
	initiative to end the war and the superpowers should impose an
	arms embargo against Tehran if it refused to negotiate.
	    He said the United States should also threaten to mine and
	blockade Iran if it continued fighting and must press Iraq to
	acknowledge responsibility for starting the war as part of a
	settlement.
	    Iranian and Western diplomats say Iraq started the war by
	invading Iran's territory in 1980. Iraq blames Iran for the
	outbreak of hostilities, which have entailed World War I-style
	infantry attacks resulting in horrific casualties.
	    Each side has attacked the others' shipping.
