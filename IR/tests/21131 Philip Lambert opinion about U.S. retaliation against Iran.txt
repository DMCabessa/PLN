	AMPLE SUPPLIES LIMIT U.S. STRIKE'S OIL PRICE IMPACT

CONTENT:
	Ample supplies of OPEC crude weighing on
	world markets helped limit and then reverse oil price gains
	that followed the U.S. Strike on an Iranian oil platform in the
	Gulf earlier on Monday, analysts said.
	    December loading rose to 19.65 dlrs, up 45 cents before
	falling to around 19.05/15 later, unchanged from last Friday.
	    "Fundamentals are awful," said Philip Lambert, analyst with
	stockbrokers Kleinwort Grieveson, adding that total OPEC
	production in the first week of October could be above 18.5 mln
	bpd, little changed from September levels.
	    Peter Nicol, analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank, said OPEC
	production could be about 18.5-19.0 mln in October. Reuter and
	International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates put OPEC September
	production at 18.5 mln bpd.
	    The U.S. Attack was in retaliation of last Friday's hit of
	a Kuwaiti oil products tanker flying the U.S. Flag, the Sea
	Isle City. It was struck by a missile, believed to be Iranian,
	in Kuwaiti waters, and was the first hit on a U.S. Flag
	commercial vessel in the seven year Iran/Iraq war.
	    The U.S. Owned Liberian flag tanker Sungari was hit in the
	area on Thursday, also believed struck by an Iranian missile.
	    Refiners were not significant purchasers of physical oil on
	Monday as a result increased Gulf tension following the U.S.
	Attack, analysts said.
	    They said a closure of the Strait of Hormuz, through which
	around eight mln bpd passes, isnlikely because it is not in
	the interests of the U.S. Or Iran, they said.
	    Any threat to oil supplies would stem from an increase in
	the number of tanker attacks as part of a widening of Gulf
	hostilities, analysts said.
	    But they saw the U.S. Strike as a limited reply to Iranian
	missile attacks, with some describing it as responsible.
	    Geoffrey Pyne, analyst at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew,
	said he was impressed by the sensible U.S. Response.
	    "The U.S. Has thought carefully about what would correspond
	to Iranian agression. They have proved to the Iranians that any
	further action will be met with a like-for-like response.
	Today's action by the U.S. Was not escalatory," Pyne said.
	    Kleinwort Grieveson's Lambert said the U.S. Strike was "a
	responsible retaliation," with the U.S. Apparently indicating to
	Iran that it could increase the severity of its attacksf Iran
	chose to raise the level of conflict.
	    Chase Manhattan's Nicol took a different view, however.
	    He said he was unable to see what the U.S. Had achieved as
	Arab states such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, whose interests
	the U.S. Is supposedly defending, will feel less secure as a
	result of the U.S. Attack and fear some sort of Iranian
	retaliation.
	    The initial upward market move this morning reflected a
	strong speculative reaction to rumours of a U.S. Attack which
	was thought at one stage to have been against Iranian missile
	launchers on the Faw Peninsula, close to Kuwait, analysts said.
	    The later downtrend followed confirmation of a U.S. Navy
	attack on an Iranian oil platform by the U.S. Defence Secretary
	Caspar Weinburger.
	    Market operators were able to evaluate the situation in the
	Gulf on the basis of confirmed fact, and finding it less
	serious than first thought, took profits, taking prices lower,
	analysts and traders said.

	TALKING POINT/GENERAL MOTORS <GM>

CONTENT:
	General Motors Corp staged an explosive
	rally on Wall Street after a share buyback program announced
	yesterday, but analysts said GM's future remains clouded by
	stiff competition and erosion of market share.
	    GM shares rose 3-1/2 to 79-1/8 in active trading. Analysts
	agreed that investors liked the repurchase program but they 
	differed sharply over the carmaker's long term prospects.
	    "I'm very positive on GM," said Jack Kirnan of Kidder
	Peabody and Co. "They're clearly committed to enhancing
	shareholder value."
	    However, some analysts worry about how GM will pay for the
	buyback and whether new models will enable the carmaker to
	recapture lost market share.
	    After the market had closed yesterday, GM said it would buy
	back 20 pct of its common stock by the end of 1990. The
	announcement sent investors today scrambling for GM shares,
	with more than 3.2 mln shares changing hands by mid-day.
	    The buyback plan caused several analysts bullish on the
	stock to reiterate buy recommendations this morning, and at
	least one increased his earnings estimates for GM based on a
	good performance expected from new car models.
	    But David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc said the
	repurchase program is not a positive.
	    "The buyback doesn't really change the earnings outlook and
	puts more stress on the balance sheet," he said, since GM will
	have to borrow money to pay for the stock purchases. The stock
	should settle back down to around 76, he added.
	    Healy projects GM will earn five dlrs a share in 1987 and
	5.50 dlrs in 1988, compared to 1986 earnings of 8.21 dlrs.
	Healy's numbers are near the low end of Wall Street estimates,
	which range from five dlrs to 7.80 dlrs in 1987 and from four
	dlrs to 10.80 dlrs in 1988.
	    Like other analysts, Healy sees GM's share of the domestic
	car and truck market falling in 1987. "On balance, GM cars are
	not selling as well as their competitors," he said.
	    In late February, GM car sales fell 8.6 pct from the
	year-ago period while competitors Ford Motor Co <F> and
	Chrysler Corp <C> both posted increases. But GM said February
	sales showed improvement over January, adding that it expects
	improvement in coming months.
	    Overall, GM's share of U.S. car and truck sales should fall
	to around 38 or 39 pct in 1987 from 41 pct at the end of 1986,
	analysts said. The numbers include imports.
	    Kidder Peabody's Kirnan said cost reductions and product
	improvements this year should lead to positive cash flow by the
	fourth quarter, which will help GM finance the buyback.
	    "GM (stock) has been a real laggard and now it's rolling up
	its sleeves and getting serious. I think there's a major
	earnings surprise in the winds," he said.
	    Kirnan raised his earnings estimates slightly today, in
	part in reaction to the announced buyback, and sees GM earning
	5.65 dlrs this year and 9.75 dlrs in 1988. "The company is more
	concerned than ever about improving their relative valuation
	with respect to Ford and Chrysler," he said.
	    Another positive for the stock is GM's dividend, currently
	five dlrs a share annually, which gives it a higher yield than
	its competitors, Kirnan said. And GM will raise the cash
	dividend 25 to 50 cts a share next year, he predicted.
	    But analyst Michael Lucky of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc
	said U.S. car sales will weaken, and GM's new products, if
	successful, will only slow but not halt the erosion of its
	market share.
	    "I believe their new cars will be successful, but that will
	only curtail losses in market share," which will fall to around
	35 pct by 1990, Lucky said.
	    Philip Fricke of Goldman Sachs and Co falls in the middle
	of the bulls and bears. While he is recommending GM stock, he
	said results will not improve until 1988.
	    "I'm not looking for improvement this year. This is a
	transition year for GM," he said.
	    Fricke, who estimates 1987 earnings at 7.80 dlrs and 1988
	at 10.80 dlrs, said cost cutting and new car models will not
	affect 1987 results. "But the key thing isn't so much what they
	earn this year. It's the momentum beyond this year that's
	important."

	TALKING POINT/EASTERN AIRLINES <TEX>
TOPICS:
	
PLACES:
	usa
CONTENT:
	A rash of firings, fears of mass layoffs
	and management overtures for wage concessions have set the
	stage for all-out war between Eastern Airlines and its unions,
	analysts and labor leaders say.
	    The bitter labor-management dispute has hurt efforts to
	revive the ailing carrier and could ultimately lead Texas Air,
	Eastern's new owner, to tranfer scores of Eastern jets to its
	non-union sister airlines, analysts said.
	    "It's a trump card that Texas Air could resort to if things
	get bad enough -- repainting Eastern planes and shifting them
	over Continental Airlines," said Louis Marckesano, an analyst
	for Janney Montgomery Scott Inc of Philadelphia.
	    Eastern lost 130.8 mln dlrs in 1986, and analysts see
	little chance of the carrier returning to profitability this
	year.
	    Since the Miami-based carrier was taken over by Texas Air
	last year, the morale of Eastern's 38,000 employees has
	plummeted, workers and labor leaders say.
	    Some Eastern officials acknowledge privately that morale
	problems have contributed to high absenteeism and a decline in
	customer service, triggering a barrage of passenger complaints.
	    Union leaders are accusing Eastern's managers -- many of
	them newly installed by Texas Air chairman Frank Lorenzo -- of
	conducting a campaign of harassment and intimidation aimed at
	ridding the airline of high-paid, senior employees.
	    "It's an underhanded way of forcing experienced people out
	in an attempt to cut the company's labor costs," said Nancy
	Tauss, vice president of the Transport Workers Union Local 553.
	    Some flight attendants complain that they are being stalked
	by what they call "spyriders" -- teams of auditors they say
	have been hired by Lorenzo to fly on Eastern jets and secretly
	examine flight crew performance.
	    Since the beginning of the year, at least a dozen flight
	attendants have been fired as a result of such audits, some for
	having as little as two dlrs missing from liquor sales and
	movie headset rentals, Tauss said.
	    Eastern officials acknowledge that management is tightening
	its accounting procedures and cracking down on absenteeism,
	which the airline says cost 70 mln dlrs last year -- the 
	highest in the industry.
	    But Eastern spokeman Jim Ashlock denied that the Miami-base
	airline was using unfair labor tactics. "We're just trying to
	correct long-standing problems and that causes some
	dissatisfaction," he said.
	    U.S. Rep. Newt Gingrich, a Georgia Republican, has met with
	groups of dissident Eastern employees in Atlanta and is
	reported to have told them he may call for hearings on the
	airline's labor tactics.
	    Labor and management have a long history of bitter
	relations at Eastern Airlines.
	    But the conflict has escalated sharply since January 21,
	when Eastern president Philip Bakes called for a reduction of
	490 mln dlrs, or 29 pct, in annual labor costs, mostly through
	union concessions.
	    Eastern's three principal unions have rejected demands for
	wage cuts and have refused to open their contracts for
	renegotiation.
	    Union officials say that in retaliation for their
	resistance, the airline has launched a "firing frenzy" aimed at
	intimidating employees and squeezing concessions from labor.
	    During 1986 -- the year in which Texas Air managers assumed
	control of Eastern -- 123 flight attendants were fired.  That
	was nearly five times greater than 1985, the union said. In the
	first two months of this year 35 flight attendants losing their
	jobs, according to union records.
	    Other unions report similar losses.
	    Texas Air last month said it would switch six of Eastern's
	wide-body jets to Continental, its cut-rate sister airline.
	    Eastern has begun hiring other Texas Air carriers to repair
	its planes in several cities and plans to shut down some
	maintenance bases, according to a recent internal memo.
	    "Texas Air is not going to write checks to Eastern to
	underwrite an outmoded labor cost structure," Bakes told a
	meeting of Miami businessmen this month. He denied, however,
	that Lorenzo planned to strip Eastern of its assets.

	SENATE BACKS U.S. RETALIATION IN GULF
TOPICS:

CONTENT:
	The U.S. Senate on Tuesday backed
	President Reagan's retaliatory strike against Iranian targets
	in the Gulf as it moved to take a greater role in making policy
	in the volatile region.
	    Senators voted 92-1 for a non-binding measure that endorsed
	Monday's U.S. attack on two Iranian oil platforms in
	retaliation for an Iranian attack last Friday on a Kuwaiti ship
	flying the American flag.
	    The measure said the attack was a firm indication of U.S.

	United States with impunity."
	    Earlier, the Senate cut off Republican stalling tactics and
	set a vote on a measure that could give Congress a larger role
	in making Gulf policy. The measure, however, does not require
	Reagan to comply with the 1973 War Powers Act, which could lead
	to a pullout of U.S. forces from the Gulf.
	    While Democrats and Republicans praised the U.S.
	retaliatory strike, many voiced new fears about the growing
	U.S. involvement in the Gulf and some demanded that Reagan

	INVESTMENT CRUCIAL TO U.S. TEXTILE RECOVERY
TOPICS:

PLACES:

CONTENT:
	With more private investment, not more
	protection, the U.S. textile industry could become competitive
	with the most modern foreign producers, analysts from two
	congressional agencies said today.
	    The Office of Technology Assessment, a nonpartisan arm of
	Congress told a House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee hearing
	there was still concern for the future of parts of the U.S.
	textile and apparel industry, but there was more reason for
	optimism than a few years ago.
	    "While textile producers are making significant
	investments, they could do more," OTA analyst Henry Kelly said.
	    The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the nonpartisan
	budget analysis arm of Congress, said federal loans or loan
	guarantees would be preferable options for Congress rather than
	increased trade protection which could lead to foreign
	retaliation.
	    CBO analyst Edward Gramlich said past trade protections,
	first imposed in the 1950's have had only a small benefit for
	profits and investments of domestic firms.
	    Trade Subcommittee chairman, Rep. Sam Gibbons, said the
	agencies analyses seemed to agree with his opinion against
	congressional approval of protectionist textile quota
	legislation aimed mainly at Western Europe, Japan and other
	Asian textile producing countries.
	    President Reagan last year vetoed a textile protection bill
	but it was reintroduced in this session of Congress and is
	expected to be voted on in the House this year.
	    However, approval this year is in doubt because passage of
	a major trade bill without specific protections for textiles
	showed a weakening of support for the legislation.
	    Most U.S. producers have fallen behind other foreign
	producers in the use of modern textile and apparel production
	equipment and net imports are growing faster than the domestic
	markets, Kelly said.
	    He added that private investment in the textile and
	clothing industry in 1983 of 0.5 pct was less than one-seventh
	the average manufacturing investment of 3.9 pct.
	    Despite existing import quotas and tariffs, imports of
	textiles grew 26 pct in 1986 and imports of apparel grew 14 pct
	while U.S. production rose only 1.9 pct.
	    "The traditional industry seems destined to be replaced by
	new technology, imports, or some combination of both. While the
	industry may not be able to compete in all domestic markets
	that it enjoyed twenty years ago, the results of our research
	indicate that portions of the domestic market can be recovered,
	and that exports can be expanded," Kelly said.

	TOWER REPORT DIMINISHES REAGAN'S HOPES OF REBOUND
TOPICS:
	
PLACES:
	usa
CONTENT:
	The Tower Commission report, which
	says President Reagan was ignorant about much of the Iran arms
	deal, just about ends his prospects of regaining political
	dominance in Washington, political analysts said.
	    "This is certification of incompetence," private political
	analyst Stephen Hess told Reuters in commenting on the Tower
	report made public today.
	    "It's as if he went before a professional licensing board
	and was denied credentials."
	    In one of the most direct criticisms, board chairman John
	Tower, a longtime Reagan supporter and former Republican
	senator from Texas, told a press conference, "The president
	clearly did not understand the nature of this operation."
	    The report, which lent credence to widespread opinion in
	Washington that Reagan is not in full command of the
	government, was particularly damaging because it was prepared
	by a board of the Republican president's own choosing.
	    The three-member panel made up of Tower, former National
	Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and former Secretary of State
	Edmund Muskie, does not carry the partisan taint of criticism
	from a Congress controlled by the Democratic party.
	    "We're falling by our own hand," said one Republican
	political strategist. "What can we say except 'we're sorry, we
	won't do it again'?"
	    The strategist, who works for one of his party's top 1988
	presidential contenders and asked not to be identified, said
	the report was like "an anvil falling on us."
	    Hess, with the Brookings Institution public policy study
	group, said the report is the final blow to Reagan's hopes of
	regaining the upper hand he once had in dealings with Congress,
	the press and the Washington bureaucracy.
	    The report may also undermine the standing of Defense
	Secretary Caspar Weinberger and Secretary of State George
	Shultz, who the report suggests were more interested in keeping
	their own skirts clean than supporting the president.
	    "They protected the record as to their own positions on this
	issue. They were not energetic in attempting to protect the
	president from the consequences," it said.
	    White House chief of staff Donald Regan and former Central
	Intelligence Agency Director William Casey also received strong
	criticism, but the blows were expected in their cases.
	    Regan, expected to resign or be fired shortly, was savaged
	for allegedly failing both to help Reagan conduct the Iran
	initiative and to avoid "chaos" in the disclosure process.
	    Casey, who underwent surgery for removal of a cancerous
	brain tumor in December, had already resigned for health
	reasons last month.
	    "This is a story about people who came up somewhat short of
	being heroes," Tower told reporters.
	    While Reagan retains considerable constitutional powers,
	including command of the armed forces and the right to veto
	legislation, analysts say it will be difficult for him to
	retake control of the country's policy agenda -- particularly
	with Congress controlled by the Democrats.
	    The crucial remaining question, they said, is whether the
	man in the street will forsake Reagan over the affair.
	    Although his job approval rating has fallen as much as
	twenty percentage points in some opinion polls since the arms
	deal with Iran became public last November, his personal
	popularity is still relatively high.
	    A Los Angeles Times poll released earlier this week showed
	that just 37 pct of those surveyed thought Reagan was in
	control of the government, but 55 pct still thought he was
	doing a good job as president.
	    American Enterprise Institute analyst William Schneider, a
	Democrat, says Reagan's loss of support among Washington power
	brokers could be offset by continued backing of the public.
	    "In the past, he has been able to go around the power elite
	by appealing directly to the public," Schneider said.
	    Reagan will again plead his case that way in a televised
	address next week.
	    But one top Republican strategist warned against expecting
	a dramatic turnaround.
	    "The White House has to avoid building expectations that
	cannot be met," said the strategist, who requested anonymity.
	"They have to recognize there is no quick fix."
	    Analysts also point out that Reagan's personal popularity
	has not always translated into public backing for his policies.
	    They note he was dramatically rebuffed in last November's
	elections when voters rejected his appeals and restored control
	of the Senate to the Democrats.

	Iran's top war spokesman Ali Akbar
	Hashemi Rafsanjani on Tuesday called the U.S. Attacks on two of
	its Gulf oil platforms an escalation and promised retaliation.
	    "God willing, we will carry out our duty in the coming days
	and make them sorry," said Rafsanjani in a speech to Parliament
	later broadcast by Tehran Radio.
	    The Tehran leadership have been quick to threaten vengeance
	after the U.S. Raids on the rigs, one of which was destroyed.
	    President Ali Khamenei, Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi
	and now Rafsanjani within 24 hours of the U.S. Action have all
	vowed retaliation.
	    Rafsanjani, the parliamentary speaker, said, "It is not a
	threat or an attempt at intimidation when we say we will
	respond to aggression -- it is a reality and we have proved it
	in practice." He added that the American attack "squares neither
	with its superpower image nor its claim of concern with
	security, nor reason and wisdom."
	    U.S. Warships shelled an Iranian offshore oil platform and
	American special forces boarded another, destroying equipment.
	    The U.S. Government said the attack was a measured response
	to an Iranian missile attack on the American-flagged Kuwaiti
	tanker Sea Isle City in Kuwaiti waters last Friday.

	France voiced its comprehension for a U.S.
	Attack on an Iranian target while calling for a swift halt to
	the Gulf War to avoid further escalation.
	    "The French authorities reaffirm their attachment to the
	freedom and security of navigation and to the right of all
	states to take action under international law and the United
	Nations charter to halt attacks such as that of October 16," the
	Foreign Ministry spokesman said in a statement.
	    The United States said its forces destroyed an Iranian oil
	platform in the Gulf and struck at a second on Monday in
	retaliation for a recent Iranian missile attack on a
	U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti ship.
	    Washington said the platforms were used to monitor shipping
	and to launch small-boat attacks on shipping. The French
	statement described the target as "an Iranian military platform."
	    But the French statement added that "everything must be done
	now to avoid that these military developments lead to a new
	escalation of the conflict."

	LATEST ATTACK SEEN POINTING UP DILEMMAS FOR US

CONTENT:
	Military experts say the United States
	faces a dilemma in the Gulf following U.S. destruction of an
	Iranian oil platform in retaliation for an attack on a
	U.S.-flagged tanker.
	    The experts told Reuters Tehran holds the initiative and is
	likely to control the tempo and direction of the conflict as
	long as America simply reacts to Iranian attacks by launching
	limited retaliatory strikes.
	    But if Washington seizes the initiative with bolder steps
	-- such as mining Iran's harbors, blockading its shipping, or
	destroying key bases -- it could find itself in a major war.
	    "Iran is in the driver's seat in an absolute sense as the
	cycle of attack and retaliation continues," said Fred Axelgard,
	a Gulf War expert with the private Center for Strategic and
	International Studies (CSIS).
	    "It's like a Greek tragedy," said retired Adm. Eugene Carroll
	of Washington's private Center for Defense Information (CDI)
	think tank.
	    Some Middle East experts say the only way out is for
	Washington to join forces with Moscow in pressing for an end to
	the war between Iran and Iraq.
	    They say it is not feasible for America to withdraw its
	30-ship force from the Gulf area, where the Navy began
	escorting U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers in July. Withdrawal 
	would give the appearance of being chased away by Iran, which
	President Reagan could never accept.
	    U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger told a Pentagon
	news conference the destroyers Kidd, Young, Leftwich and Hoel
	fired about 1,000 rounds of five-inch shells at Iran's Rostam
	oil rig 120 miles east of Bahrain beginning at about 1400 Gulf
	time (0700 EDT) on Monday.
	    Weinberger said the platform had been used as a military
	base by Iran and that the attack responded to an Iranian
	Silkworm missile strike on the U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker Sea
	Isle City on Friday.
	    Iranians manning the platform were warned in advance and
	allowed to escape.
	    "We do not seek further confrontation with Iran, but we will
	be prepared to meet any escalation of military action by Iran
	with stronger countermeasures," Weinberger said.
	    "We consider this matter closed," he said.
	    Analysts ranging from the liberal CDI to conservatives
	agreed the U.S. reaction was measured, reasonable and did not
	escalate the conflict unduly. But they said the question was
	whether Iran would consider the matter closed. It had not taken
	this view after earlier clashes.

	ITC CONTESTS USE OF DOCUMENTS AS COURT EVIDENCE

CONTENT:
	The International Tin Council, ITC,
	intervened in a High Court hearing in an attempt to prevent the
	presentation of internal Council documents as evidence.
	    The intervention in Shearson Lehman's action against the
	London Metal Exchange over its "ring out" of tin contracts in
	1986 is likely to have implications for other cases in which
	the Council is involved following the collapse of its buffer
	stock operations in October 1985, ITC delegates said.
	    The ITC's case is being presented by Professor Rosalyn
	Higgins and is expected to take a further one or two days next
	week. Court does not sit tomorrow.
	    In essence the Council is claiming that its status is
	similar to that of a foreign embassy and that its archives can
	therefore not be used in an English court of law.
	    The Council ended its quarterly session today ahead of
	schedule. The meeting had been expected to go on until tomorrow
	when the European Community's legal advisers were due to
	attend, but delegates reviewed the progress of the various
	legal actions today.
	    Otherwise, the meeting was occupied with internal
	administrative matters, delegates said.
	    The ITC will continue to operate with a reduced staff after
	June 30 following the two year extension of the sixth
	International Tin Agreement.
	    As well as dealing with the ongoing litigation, the Council
	will continue with its statistical work and carry out some
	research studies, although staffing in the research department
	is being cut to one from two previously.
	    At this week's session the Council elected Philip Sparkes
	of Australia as first vice-chairman for the producing members
	and Heinz Hofer of Switzerland as second vice-chairman for the
	consumers for the year from July 1. Future quarterly sessions
	are scheduled for October 5/7 and December 14/16.
