	help spur U.S. Trade and improve business relations with China,
	South Korea and the Philippines, U.S. Officials say.
	    Baldrige will also stop in Hong Kong to meet British
	officials and local U.S. And Hong Kong businessmen.
	    The U.S. Last year had major deficits with three of its

	Philippines was 800 mln dlrs.
	    Baldrige will meet South Korean President Chun Doo-hwan and
	Trade Minister Rha Woong Bae on Monday to discuss opening South
	Korean markets to more U.S. Goods.
	    Baldrige will be in Peking from April 21 to 24. He will
	meet Zheng Tuobin, minister for foreign economic relations and
	trade, attend a meeting of the U.S.-China Joint Commission on
	Commerce and Trade and address a management and training
	organisation.
	    However, U.S. Officials said a chief purpose of Baldrige's
	visit would be to discuss relaxed U.S. Rules for transferring
	modern technology to Chinese industries.
	    In Hong Kong, Baldrige will hold meetings on April 27 with
	Governor David Wilson and Trade and Industry Secretary Eric Ho,
	as well as addressing the American Chamber of Commerce.
	    U.S. Officials said Baldrige will meet Philippines
	President Corazon Aquino on April 28 to show continued U.S.
	Support for her government and to discuss steps it could take
	to improve the atmosphere for American investment.

	PHILIPPINES APPROVES NEW CAR PROGRAMME
TOPICS:

CONTENT:
	Philippines' Board of Investments (BOI)
	has approved new guidelines on making cars but is still
	awaiting rules on the tax component of the programme, trade and
	industry secretary Jose Concepcion said.
	    He said the authorities were still deciding how much tax
	will be levied on locally-assembled cars.
	    The new car development programme replaces an earlier
	scheme and is designed to limit the number of car manufacturers
	in the local market.
	    The scheme is to be unveiled before the end of the month.
	    The two accredited local car manufacturers are <Pilipinas
	Nissan Inc>, which gets car kits from Nissan Motor Company Ltd
	<NSAN.T> and <Philippine Automotive Manufacturing Corp> which
	gets supplies from Mitsubishi Corp <MITT.T>.
	    Three companies which pulled out due to what they saw as
	poor market conditions were Ford Philippines, a subsidiary of
	Ford Motor Co <F>, General Motors Pilipinas, a subsidiary of
	General Motors Corp <GM> and <Delta Motors Corp>.
	    Toyota Motor Corp <TOYO.T>, which was the foreign partner
	of Delta Motors, has applied for a place in the new programme
	and is negotiating the purchase of Delta's assembly plant.
	    Concepcion declined to say how many car assemblers would be
	allowed to operate, but said they will be required to finance
	75 pct of the foreign exchange needed to import
	completely-knocked-down kits.
	    The balance will be provided by the central bank, he said.
	    The trade minister, who is also chairman of the BOI, said
	the programme is intended to develop a car parts industry by
	requiring car firms to use locally-made spare parts. He said
	the plan should keep car prices at "reasonable levels."
	    Tax currently accounts for 40 pct of the total cost of a
	car.

	PHILIPPINES TO IMPORT CEMENT FROM INDONESIA
TOPICS:
	
PLACES:
	philippines, indonesia
CONTENT:
	The Philippines will import 250,000 bags
	of cement worth 375,000 dlrs from Indonesia by the end of the
	month to meet growing demand from the construction sector,
	Trade and Industry Secretary Jose Concepcion said.
	    He told reporters that local cement manufacturers had
	stepped up production but were falling short of demand. "The
	only solution is to import," he added.
	    Concepcion said average monthly requirements of cement in
	1986 were 6.7 mln bags while supply hovered around 9.3 mln
	bags, but this year demand had grown to 10.4 mln bags per
	month.
	    Trade and Industry sources said construction sector
	representatives estimated an additional 70,000 bags would be
	required daily to meet demand.
	    Cement is officially priced at 48.50 pesos per bag, but
	construction industry sources said it was selling at black
	market rates of up to 65 pesos a bag in some areas.
	    The sources said falling interest rates as well as a
	government budget of four billion pesos in 1987 for low-cost
	housing had fuelled a construction boom.

	(CORRECTED) - PHILIPPINES CRITICISES EC FOR OIL LEVY
TOPICS:
	trade, veg-oil, coconut-oil
PLACES:
	new-zealand, philippines
CONTENT:
	Philippines Trade and
	Industry Secretary Jose Concepcion told world trade ministers
	he wondered if their agreement was of any real value after the
	European Community (EC) proposed a levy on vegetable oils.
	    Concepcion, speaking at an informal meeting of the General
	Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) here, said ministers
	declared in Uruguay last September that the trade of
	less-developed nations should not be disrupted.
	    He said the EC not only ignored Manila's request for lower
	tariffs on coconut oil but proposed a levy on vegetable oils
	and fats that are vital exports for Southeast Asian countries.
	    Concepcion said while the levy might be rejected by the EC
	Council of Ministers, he noted that "I cannot help but wonder
	whether the agreements we produce in meetings like this are of
	any real value."
	    He also said industrialised nations saved about 65 billion
	U.S. Dlrs in 1985 through low commodity prices, but this had
	affected the ability of developing nations to import goods and
	services.
	    "The health and the growth of world trade requires that the
	new development of developing countries losing their share of
	world trade be arrested and reversed," he said.

	PHILIPPINE TRADE SECRETARY PLEASED WITH GATT TALKS
TOPICS:
	trade
PLACES:
	new-zealand, philippines
CONTENT:
	Philippine Secretary of
	Trade and Industry Jose Concepcion, who two days ago expressed
	doubts about agreements produced at international conferences,
	said he was pleased with the latest gathering here.
	    Concepcion told Reuters in an interview that the informal
	General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) meeting gave
	ministers from more than 20 nations the chance to examine
	issues with which GATT did not have the political will to deal.
	    "Also, the role of the developing countries has been
	emphasised in this particular meeting. Somehow it has been the
	perception of developing countries that GATT is a club of rich
	countries," he added in an interview with Reuters.
	    "In fact many of the issues that have been tabled for
	discussion (in the Uruguay round of trade negotiations) will be
	of more benefit to the developed countries," he said.
	    Concepcion said at the start of the Taupo meeting that the
	Uruguay round was meant to be a "shining act of faith" in the
	world trade system.
	    Concepcion said the Philippines would address the issues of
	trade in tropical fruit and the improvement of GATT machinery
	to make it more responsive.
	    He said tropical fruit came from developing countries but
	faced non-tariff barriers, quantitative restrictions or very
	high duties in other nations. Concepcion named Japan and South
	Korea as examples.
	    He said he would go to Wellington for talks with New
	Zealand, which had a surplus in trade with the Philippines, to
	encourage it to switch imports from other countries. He noted
	that New Zealand bought its bananas from Ecuador.
