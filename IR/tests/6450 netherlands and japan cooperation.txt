	    The talks were the first high-level international review of

	the U.S., West Germany, France, Britain, Japan and Canada to
	stabilise world currency markets at around present levels
	following the 40 pct slide in the dollar since mid-1985.
	    Other countries represented at today's talks were Italy,
	which refused to attend last month's meeting on the grounds
	that it was being excluded from the real discussions, the
	Netherlands, Belgium and Switzerland.
	    Many of the officials had met earlier today and yesterday

	must cooperate closely if they want to save their electronics
	industry from dropping to a third-rate global position, NV
	Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken <PLGO.AS> chairman Cor van der
	Klugt told a congress here.
	    Noting that Europe was now a net importer of Integrated
	Circuits, Van der Klugt said that in information technology,
	the European Community had posted a trade deficit in 1984 of
	five billion ecus compared with a 1975 surplus of 1.7 billion
	ecus.
	    Such factors were forcing European electronics companies to
	seek cooperation with others both inside and outside Europe.
	    Van der Klugt cited Western Europe's joint high-technology
	research programme ESPRIT, sponsored by the European Community,
	as a useful programme for what he called "pre-competitive
	cooperation" with other companies in the same or related fields.
	    The Philips president said companies should join such
	efforts in an attempt to gain a foothold in markets of
	strategic importance such as the U.S. And Japan.
	    Working together, firms could produce on a larger scale and
	more cheaply by sharing business risks and pooling together
	development, marketing and production activities, he said.
	    As an example, Van der Klugt pointed to Philips'
	telecommunications joint venture with AT and T <T.N> of the
	U.S. To form <APT>, working on digital telephone exchange
	projects.
	    "Only the largest companies can recoup the billions of
	dollars involved in development in this area," he said, adding
	that the world market offered room for no more than seven or
	eight manufacturers of such products.

	It is vitally important that the
	industrialised countries of the world work towards convergence
	of their economies and economic policies, U.S. Ambassador to
	the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
	Edward Streator said.
	    He told an American Chamber of Commerce lunch the world was
	changing rapidly and national attitudes had to alter
	accordingly if growth was not to falter and world depression
	set in.
	    Liberalisation of world trade in money, goods and services
	and technology was an overriding goal, he added.
	    World financial flows were now 12 times as large as
	traditional trade flows, the importance of commodities was
	declining rapidly, countries such as those on the Pacific Rim
	were becoming major growth areas, and the labour element in
	manufacturing was declining sharply, Streator said.
	    All these factors were creating major social and economic
	pressures and demanding a rapid reassessment of traditional
	attitudes, he added.
	    "Agriculture is a prime target for change.One of the first
	things we must do is disconnect farm subsidies from production,"
	Streator said.
	    At an OECD ministerial meeting in two weeks time there
	would be an attempt to agree global principles to help reduce
	this major agricultural problem, Streator said.
	    "However, of equal and vital importance in reducing the
	world's dangerous slide towards protectionism will be the
	outcome of the new round of talks under the General Agreement
	on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)," Streator added.
	    Dutch finance minister Onno Ruding, who also spoke briefly
	at the lunch, stressed the importance of coordinating national
	policies and of the GATT talks in preventing a rapid decline
	into bilateralism and global protectionism.

	Economic growth will remain sluggish in

	forecast.
	    Belgium's GDP growth may slow down to 1.5 pct this year and
	next year, bringing a rise in the number of jobless, the OECD
	said in its semi-annual survey. Belgian inflation could
	stabilise at 1.5 to 2.0 pct, while the current account surplus
	will probably remain large at about three pct of GDP.
	    While the Belgian government has made progress in trimming
	its borrowing requirement, "it will probably be insufficient to
	check the self-sustaining nature of the deficit," the OECD said.
	    In the Netherlands real GDP growth will also slip to 1.5
	pct this year and one pct in 1988, with Dutch exports becoming
	less competitive and imports rising. "Employment is forecast to
	decelerate as well, reflecting more sluggish growth in the
	private sector and budgetary cuts," the report said.
	    Dutch consumer prices are set to fall by 0.5 pct in 1987
	and stay stable in 1988, partly as a result of declining
	domestic gas prices.
	    Luxembourg's economy, by contrast, will see slightly faster
	growth in GDP this year as a result of an upward movement in
	wages. But real growth in consumption will ease next year.

	Taiwan's state-owned China Shipbuilding
	Corp (CSBC) plans to seek joint production agreements with
	Japan and further diversify into ship repairing to try to trim
	its debts, chairman Louis Lo said.
	    He told Reuters in an interview that CSBC's first joint
	production venture, to build two hulls for <Onomichi Dockyard
	Co Ltd>, was a success. Talks on similar projects have been
	held with other Japanese firms, including Mitsubishi Heavy
	Industries Co Ltd <MITH.T> and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy
	Industries Co Ltd <JIMA.T>, he said.
	    Lo said CSBC delivered the hulls of two 2,200-TEU (twenty
	foot equivalent unit) container ships this year to Onomichi,
	which would complete production.
	    "We expect the successful cooperation between us and
	Onomichi will pave the way for further cooperation with other
	Japanese shipbuilders in the future," Lo said.
	    He said Japanese firms would gain from the lower cost of
	shipbuilding in Taiwan while CSBC would benefit from Japanese
	technology and marketing. This would pose a challenge to
	competitors in Europe and South Korea.
	    Lo said CSBC has made losses of about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs
	since beginning operations in 1975. Its total debt now stands
	at about 500 mln dlrs, with annual interest payments of nearly
	three mln dlrs.
	    But he said the company, which is Taiwan's largest
	shipbuilder, still has full government support and had begun
	diversifying into ship repairing and manufacture of pipes and
	other machinery.
	    "We hope we can survive and prosper through diversification,"
	he said.
	    Lo said income from ship repairing almost doubled to 20 mln
	U.S. Dlrs in the year ended June 1986 compared with the
	previous financial year. He estimated income would rise to more
	than 25 mln dlrs in 1986/87.
	    CSBC has orders to build 10 ships totalling 460,000 dead
	weight tons (dwt) this financial year, compared with 11 ships
	of 462,000 dwt in 1985/86, he said.
	    Lo said the prospects for shipbuilding were gloomy at least
	until 1991 due to overtonnage, but the outlook for ship
	repairing was bright.

	U.S. SAID TO VIEW G-7 MEETING AS MAJOR SUCCESS
TOPICS:

CONTENT:
	The United States, which has long
	sought Japanese action to stimulate its economy, appears to be
	satisfied Tokyo's latest package is a major development and
	allows leading industrial nations to reaffirm their agreement
	to stabilize currencies.
	    Monetary sources said they believed that U.S. Treasury
	Secretary James Baker considered Tokyo's package, announced
	yesterday, to be a major stimulation of the Japanese economy.
	    But yesterday's statement by seven leading industrial
	powers endorses the yen's rise from around 153 to the dollar,
	the level at the February 22 Paris Accord, to about 145 today.
	    The supplementary budget worth about 34.48 billion dlrs was
	announced by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on the eve of
	Miyazawa's departure for Washington, to attend yesterday's
	meetings of leading industrial nations.
	    In a strongly worded statement terming the Japanese action
	"extraordinary and urgent", the meeting reaffirmed the Paris
	Accord by noting that current exchange rates are within ranges
	broadly consistent with fundamentals, or economic reality.
	    The Group of Seven -- the United States, Japan, West
	Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- therefore
	repeated their willingness to continue close cooperation to
	foster exchange rate stability.
	    The cooperation agreement has resulted in concerted central
	bank intervention of 8 billion to 9 billion dlrs to halt the
	dollar's fall. While relatively unsuccessful, the scale of
	intervention between so many nations is unprecedented in recent
	years.
	    Monetary sources also said they understood that Secretary
	Baker considered the meeting to be extremely successful in the
	light of the Japanese announcement.
	    They also said there was a growing feeling among the
	finance ministers and central bankers that cooperation over
	medium-term policies has replaced the bickering over short-term
	differences in past meetings.
	    West Germany, whose currency has not risen anything like
	the yen since the Paris Agreement, appears from the face of
	yesterday's statement to have won acceptance from other
	countries that its exchange rate is acceptable.
	    Bonn's finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg argues that
	major currency shifts needed to remedy the huge imbalance
	between West Germany and Japan's trade surpluses and America's
	trade deficit have already taken place.
	    No mention was made, however, of the U.S. commitment to cut
	the budget deficit even though it is implied in the
	reafffirmation of Paris.
	    European nations and Japan believe deficit cuts are
	essential to curbing the record U.S. trade shortfall that
	reached nearly 170 billion dlrs last year.
	    A similar argument was made on Capitol Hill earlier this
	week by Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker. A further
	sharp fall to redress trade imbalances would "clearly pose
	substantial risks of renewed inflationary momentum and could
	undermine confidence in future financial stability," he said.
	    Volcker warned a further dollar fall might force the
	politically independent Fed to drive up interest rates.
	    Monetary sources said that, privately, West Germany
	welcomed the rise in the yen against the dollar while its own
	currency remained relatively stable against the U.S. unit.
	    Bonn and other European nations worry that once the weak
	dollar blunts Tokyo's export drive to the United States, the
	Japanese monolith will concentrate on European markets.
	    The ministers, meanwhile, also continued talks on making
	their policy coordination more binding and one, Canadian
	Finance Minister Michael Wilson, said good progress was made.
	    Wilson said they will meet before the June Economic Summit
	to prepare a report for the leaders of the seven nations.
	    The United States and France, backed by the International
	Monetary Fund, want the seven to agree on ranges or "norms" for a
	limited number of economic objectives such as growth,
	inflation, monetary conditions, trade balances and current
	account balances.
	    Sharp deviations from these guidelines would result in
	consultations between the countries on whether corrective
	action should be required.
	    But the inclusion of currencies as one of the objectives
	has Bonn and London worried, monetary sources say, because it
	implies Washington is moving in the direction of target zones.
	    The sources said the Reagan administration unsuccessfully
	sounded out its allies on a system of target zones to limit
	currency fluctuations just before the February meeting.
	    The concept is a much more rigid one than the secret ranges
	of the Paris Accord and would mark a sharp departure from the
	relatively free currency markets of recent years.

	BUNDESBANK CALLS FOR CENTRAL BANK COOPERATION
TOPICS:
	interest, money-fx
PLACES:
	west-germany
CONTENT:
	Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler
	called on central banks of major industrialised nations to
	cooperate closely on exchange and interest rate policies.
	    In a lecture at the University of Surrey, pre-released
	here, Koehler said that the only alternative to cooperation was
	protectionism and control on capital movements.
	    "Central banks have sufficient experience of exchange market
	transactions to steer exchange rates where they want to have
	them," he said. He added that West German growth forecasts would
	have to be revised downward because of the recent dollar drop
	to 1.80 marks from above two marks at the start of 1987.
	    Koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange markets
	had parted company with transactions in goods, services and
	investments. It was the scale of speculative transactions that
	determined market trends.
	    Speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates to
	grow. To reverse such a rise in the money stock, interest rates
	would have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off.
	    "In other words, the monetary policy measures required are
	different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --
	those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of
	mounting economic activity," Koehler said.
	    The dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive U.S.
	Current account deficit. But attempts to keep the depreciation
	going by talking the dollar down posed problems.
	    The sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steep
	rise in the cost of U.S. Imports and a sharp fall in the cost
	of European imports. But the volume effect of falling imports
	to the U.S. And rising imports to Europe would take time to
	make itself felt compared with the price effect.
	    "Hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be going
	further than would be necessary to adjust the current account
	over the medium term," Koehler said.
	    A reduction in the U.S. Current account deficit would occur
	only if the growth rate of GNP was higher than domestic demand.
	In Japan and West Germany by contrast, domestic demand should
	rise faster than GNP.
	    "In Germany this did indeed happen in 1986," Koehler said.
	    If a further appreciation of the dollar was to be
	prevented, the U.S. Current account deficit could be offset by
	an inflow of foreign funds into the U.S..
	    But only if there was an appropriate interest rate
	differential would Europe and Japan look for financial
	investment in the U.S.
	    When selecting monetary policy instruments, a central bank
	had to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact its
	measures might have on expectations and consequent decisions.
	    Koehler said the Bundesbank was changing money market rates
	by operating on the open market rather than adjusting leading
	interest rates because of the signal this gives to the market
	and its substantial impact on exchange rates.
	    It was not only important to achieve the domestic goals of
	price stability, economic growth and full employment but also
	to tackle international problems like the exchange rate
	problem, the debt problem and the current account problem.
	    A strategy had to be designed that helped "the safeguarding
	of non-inflationary economic growth in an international
	monetary system largely free of disruptions," Koehler said.
	    Given the system of floating exchange rates, it was
	necessary for central banks to agree to intervene. It sufficed
	to tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates over
	the next few years and intervention points should not be set,
	because they were only testing points for the market, he said.
	    In order to keep the international monetary system free of
	disruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly but
	also cooperate on interest rate policies, Koehler said.

CONTENT:
	A senior British official said that
	protectionist bills being considered by Congress could trigger
	retaliation by the European Community (EEC) and threaten the
	global trading system.
	    Paul Channon, secretary for trade and industry, said if
	Congress passed legislation to curb textile imports, which
	would hit EC shipments as well as shipments from major Asian
	textile producers, "the community would have to retaliate."
	    His comments echoed those made yesterday by Belgian Trade
	Minister Herman De Croo, who said if the bill passed, the
	community would retaliate by imposing taxes on U.S. exports.
	    Channon made his remarks at a news conference after two
	days of talks with Reagan Administration officials and members
	of Congress.
	    De Croo was also in Washington for trade talks.
	    Channon said there was a greater protectionism sentiment in
	Congress since his visit here last year as Congress and the
	Administration tried to find ways to reduce the U.S. trade
	deficit, which last year hit a record 169.8 billion dlrs.
	    Channon also called for greater EC-U.S. cooperation to
	force Japan to open its markets to foreign goods.
	    Channon said Japan's trade surplus is causing everyone
	problems - its surplus with the United States last year was
	51.5 billion dlrs and with EC nations, 16.7 billion dlrs.
	    "The more united pressure there could be, the better," he
	said.
	    Channon also called for increased U.S.-EC cooperation to
	avoid trade disputes.
	    He said the two sides narrowly avoided a confrontation
	earlier this year over lost grains sales when Spain and
	Portugal joined the community and its liberal imports
	regulations were tightened to conform to EC standards.
	    "But if both sides drew back from the brink that time," he
	said, ""it does not mean that they would do so on another
	occasion."
	    Channon added that "There is increasing reesentment in
	Europe over the U.S. tactic of negotiating under the pressure
	of unilaterally imposed deadlines."
	    He said other potential conflicts are already in sight -
	alleged European government subsidies of Airbus aircraft and
	taxes on fats and oils - and "the commuity and the United States
	must therefore learn to manage their relations better."
	    He said another bill to let the United States retaliate
	against a nation if that nation's market was not open to U.S.
	goods would bypass the trade pact GATT (General Agreeeement on
	Tariffs and Trade) as an arbiter of trade practices.
	    He said foreign trade law should be judged by GATT and not
	by the United States, adding "if the (trade) law is to be
	interpreted by the United States and not by the GATT, what is
	to happen to the rest of us?"

CONTENT:
	Crude oil prices rallied today, moving
	over 17.00 dlrs a barrel because of Saudi Arabia's determined
	effort to support prices, analysts said.
	    "The Saudis and other OPEC nations are jawboning the market,
	hoping to restore confidence and prices and to do this without
	another meeting," said Sanford Margoshes, oil analyst with
	Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
	    "But OPEC is not out of the woods yet by a longshot due to
	seasonal declines in demand and some cheating," he added.
	    Oil industry analysts said Saudi Arabia has led the attempt
	to get other OPEC members to resist pressures to discount from
	the official prices agreed to last december.
	    The analysts said that to get others to hold the line,
	Saudi Arabia pushed hard at the meeting of deputy oil ministers
	of the Gulf Cooperation Council last weekend and at the
	Cooperation Council oil ministers' meeting the previous week.
	    The Saudis have also offered to support members having
	difficulty in selling their oil, analysts said.
	    "They are trying to make sure that no one discounts, and to
	prevent that, it appears that Saudi Arabia or some other OPEC
	member will allocate some of their oil sales to help members
	that lose sales," Margoshes said.
	    He added that the allocations would probably be in the form
	of loans to be repaid when these nations resume sales.
	    Analysts said this would be useful in keeping in line
	nations like Qatar, which has had trouble selling oil. But it
	is also likely that such assistance would be provided to
	Nigeria which is under pressure to extend discounts.
	    Analysts said that Saudi Arabia, with assistance from OPEC
	president Rilwanu Lukman, was trying to avoid an emergency OPEC
	meeting for fear that it would give the appearance that the
	December pact is falling apart.
	    Daniel McKinley, oil analyst with Smith Barney, Upham
	Harris and Co said, "both physical and futures markets have been
	oversold and it only took a small spark to bring on a short
	covering rally."
	    He believes an Iranian trade mission to Tokyo, which
	refused discounts to Japanese buyers, brought Japanese refiners
	into the market to cover their short positions.
	    Oil traders said one japanese refiner came into the market
	to but 10 cargoes of May Dubai, which sent prices up on Mideast
	sours, with Dubai trading up to 16.50 dlrs after trading
	yeterray as low as 15.63 dlrs and then spilled over into the
	North sea crude oil market.
	    Traders said that there have been persistent rumors today
	that Japanese buyers are looking to pick up cargoes of Brent
	for Japan and European trade sources indidate rumors of vessels
	being fixed to make such shipments.
	    North sea brent today rose over 17.00 dlrs with trades
	reported as high as 17.05 dlrs, up one dlr.
	    OPEC members' denials that they are producing over their
	quotas sparked moves to cover short postitions.
	    Indonesian oil minister Subroto said today that OPEC
	production was below the 15.8 mln bpd quota agreed to last
	december but he gave no details on OPEC production against
	claims it was more at least one mln bpd above that level.
	    "The production probably is about their quota level and
	largely because Saudi Arabia will not discount and canot sell
	its oil as a result," Margoshes said.
	    Analysts have mixed opinions about the extent of the
	current rally. Some believe prices can continue to rise if
	Saudi Arabia and OPEC hold steady in a refusal to discount.
	    But others said that despite the rally today there were
	still several fundamental factors, including demand, which
	could cut the rally short.
	    Marion Stewart, an indepedent petroleum economist, said
	slow growth in the economies of the U.S. and OECD would keep
	demand for oil slack and he now estimates that demand to rise
	about 1.4 pct over 1986.

TITLE:
	U.S. TREASURY POLICIES SAID UNCHANGED BY DEPARTURE
TOPICS:

	The departure of James Baker's
	closest aide, Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman, will
	not change the course of Washington's domestic and
	international economic policies, U.S. officials said.
	    Darman, who has worked alongside Baker for six years, was
	widely credited with helping him mastermind initiatives on
	currency management and international economic cooperation.
	    U.S. Officials said Darman also played a key role in
	shepherding President Reagan's sweeping tax reform plan through
	the U.S. Congress.
	    But they flatly dismissed suggestions that his departure,
	to the investment banking firm of Shearson Lehman Brothers,
	signaled the Baker team was breaking up, or that the Treasury
	Secretary himself might leave soon.
	    "It really does not mean that, he took the opportunity as it
	came up," one official said.
	    Another commented, "Baker will miss him, but he's not going
	to stand in his way."
	    There has been widespread speculation since last autumn
	that Darman sought a Wall Street job.
	    Officials said Darman felt the passage of tax reform late
	last year marked an appropriate moment to bow out.
	    Baker acknowledged Darman would be sorely missed.
	    "Dick Darman has contributed mightily to the success of this
	administration over the past six years and his departure
	represents a substantial loss," he said.
	    U.S. Officials admitted Darman's absence would be an
	undoubted blow to Baker, who has relied on him for policy
	advice, both at the White House and, in Reagan's second term,
	at the Treasury. One aide once described Darman as
	"indispensable" to Baker.
	    Baker is widely thought to want a more stable currency
	system and Darman is generally credited by officials of other
	nations as Baker's leading theorist on this issue, favouring
	target zones to limit currency fluctuations.
	    Earlier this year, monetary sources said the U.S. Treasury
	unsuccessfully sounded out allies on a target zone system.
	    But a U.S. Official disputed the assessment that, with
	Darman gone, Baker would abandon international initiatives.
	    Baker's work as head of Reagan's Economic Policy Council,
	spearheading trade policy, and his skills in negotiating with
	the Democrat-controlled Congress will go on as before.
	    Darman's strength was not as an economist, but as a
	political strategist "and that's Baker's strength too," the
	official said.
	    There were already indications that Baker, who throughout
	his time in government has relied on a closely-knit circle of
	advisers, has moved swiftly to find a successor.
	    One possibility is that Baker might turn to George Gould,
	who holds the number three Treasury position of
	Under-Secretary.
	    Gould, another close confidante, has known Baker for years.
	    Before joining the Treasury in November 1985, Gould was a
	partner at the Wall Steet firm of Wertheim and Co and formerly
	headed Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp.
	    The Darman announcement came on the eve of the semi-annual
	meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank,
	where many policies Darman helped shape will be debated.
	    He helped Baker devise the September, 1985 Plaza Agreement,
	when the United States, Japan, West Germany, France and Britain
	curbed the dollar's strength. The pact was a major turning
	point in U.S. Policy, ending a period of disdain for economic
	cooperation and intervention in currency markets.
	    Darman also worked on some other Baker initiatives, like
	the Tokyo Summit agreement to intensify coordination of
	economic policies among the leading industrial countries and
	the recent Paris Agreement to stabilise currencies and
	stimulate global growth.
	    These policies are collectively aimed at redressing the
	huge gap between Japan and West Germany's trade surpluses and
	the United State's massive trade deficit.
	    That policy goal still remains a prime objective of the
	Reagan Administration and will not change with Darman's
	departure.
