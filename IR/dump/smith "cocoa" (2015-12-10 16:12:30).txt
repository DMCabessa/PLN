	Showers continued throughout the week in
	the Bahia cocoa zone, alleviating the drought since early
	January and improving prospects for the coming temporao,
	although normal humidity levels have not been restored,
	Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review.
	    The dry period means the temporao will be late this year.
	    Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155,221 bags
	of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93
	mln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. Again it seems
	that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the
	arrivals figures.
	    Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how
	much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has
	practically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimates
	around 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there
	are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers,
	middlemen, exporters and processors.
	    There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit
	for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in
	obtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates.
	    In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have
	sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment.
	    Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350
	cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos.
	    Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and
	only limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1,750 to
	1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named.
	    New crop sales were also light and all to open ports with
	June/July going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs
	under New York july, Aug/Sept at 1,870, 1,875 and 1,880 dlrs
	per tonne FOB.
	    Routine sales of butter were made. March/April sold at
	4,340, 4,345 and 4,350 dlrs.
	    April/May butter went at 2.27 times New York May, June/July
	at 4,400 and 4,415 dlrs, Aug/Sept at 4,351 to 4,450 dlrs and at
	2.27 and 2.28 times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at 4,480 dlrs and
	2.27 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said.
	    Destinations were the U.S., Covertible currency areas,
	Uruguay and open ports.
	    Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for
	March/April, 785 dlrs for May, 753 dlrs for Aug and 0.39 times
	New York Dec for Oct/Dec.
	    Buyers were the U.S., Argentina, Uruguay and convertible
	currency areas.
	    Liquor sales were limited with March/April selling at 2,325
	and 2,380 dlrs, June/July at 2,375 dlrs and at 1.25 times New
	York July, Aug/Sept at 2,400 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York
	Sept and Oct/Dec at 1.25 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith
	said.
	    Total Bahia sales are currently estimated at 6.13 mln bags
	against the 1986/87 crop and 1.06 mln bags against the 1987/88
	crop.
	    Final figures for the period to February 28 are expected to
	be published by the Brazilian Cocoa Trade Commission after
	carnival which ends midday on February 27.

	INDONESIAN TEA, COCOA EXPORTS SEEN UP, COFFEE DOWN

	Indonesia's exports of tea and cocoa
	will continue to rise in calendar 1987 but coffee exports are
	forecast to dip slightly in 1987/88 (April-March) as the
	government tries to improve quality, the U.S. Embassy said.
	    The embassy's annual report on Indonesian agriculture
	forecast coffee output in 1986/87 would be 5.77 mln bags of 60
	kilograms each. That is slightly less than the 5.8 mln bags
	produced in 1985/86.
	    In 1987/88 coffee production is forecast to rise again to
	5.8 mln bags, but exports to dip to 4.8 mln from around 5.0 mln
	in 1986/87. Exports in 1985/86 were 4.67 mln bags.
	    The embassy report says coffee stocks will rise to 1.3 mln
	tonnes in 1987/88 from 1.15 mln in 1986/87. It bases this on a
	fall in exports as a result of the "probable" re-introduction of
	quotas by the International Coffee Organisation.
	    Cocoa production and exports are forecast to rise steadily
	as the government develops cocoa plantations. Production of
	cocoa in Indonesia increased to 32,378 tonnes in calendar 1985
	from 10,284 tonnes in 1980. It is projected by the government
	to rise to more than 50,000 tonnes by 1988.
	    Production in 1986 is estimated by the embassy at 35,000
	tonnes, as against 38,000 tonnes in 1987.
	    The report forecasts cocoa exports to rise to 35,000 tonnes
	this year, from 33,000 tonnes in 1986 and 31,000 in 1985.
	    The Netherlands is at present the biggest importer of
	Indonesian cocoa beans.
	    The report forecasts that in calendar 1987, Indonesia's CTC
	(crushed, torn and curled) tea exports will increase
	significantly with the coming on stream of at least eight new
	CTC processing plants.
	    Indonesia plans to diversify its tea products by producing
	more CTC tea, the main component of tea bags.
	    Production of black and green teas is forecast in the
	embassy report to rise to 125,000 tonnes in calendar 1987 from
	123,000 tonnes in 1986.
	    Exports of these teas are likely to rise to 95,000 tonnes
	in 1987 from 85,000 in 1986 and around 90,000 in 1985.
	    The embassy noted the ministry of trade tightened quality
	controls on tea in October 1986 in an effort to become more
	competititve in the world market.
