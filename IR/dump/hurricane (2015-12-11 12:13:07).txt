	WEST TEXAS COTTON CROP UNSCATHED BY STORM

	The West Texas cotton crop was largely
	unscathed by an isolated thunderstorm in that region last night
	that packed hurricane-force winds, crop and weather experts
	said.
	    "There might have been some isolated storms, but certainly
	nothing damaging," said Charles Stichler, an extension
	agronomist with the Agricultural Extension Service in far West
	Texas.
	    Rumors of a damaging storm in West Texas helped the New
	York cotton futures market rally sharply this morning.
	   Cotton for December delivery was 1.35 cents higher at 70.95
	cents a lb at midsession after peaking this morning at 71.25
	cents.
	    "What happened is that the storm hit Lubbock airport, and
	when that happens, everybody sees it," said Dale Mohler, a
	senior meteorologist with Accu-Weather Inc.
	    Lubbock is the heart of the West Texas cotton region, which
	produces about 80 pct of that state's crop.
	    The storm produced winds of about 75 mph. "That's hurricane
	force. But they were isolated to just a small portion of the
	West Texas area, probably less than five pct," Mohler said.
	    "No doubt there was some damage. But if it had hit in July
	or August (when fruiting would be underway) it would have been
	worse," Mohler said.
	    About 60 pct of the West Texas cotton crop has been
	planted, and the remainder could be done by the weekend if
	weather remains hot and dry, Stichler said.
	    The temperature in West Texas since mid-week has been about
	95 degrees. But a hot spell was sorely needed after far heavier
	than normal rainfall for several weeks, he said.

	CUBA SUGAR CROP SEEN AT LEAST SAME AS LAST YEAR

	Cuban sugar export figures for January
	suggest that this year's crop may be at least as large as last
	year's 7.35 mln tonnes, according to sugar analysts.
	    Exports in January totalled 733,000 tonnes raw value, up
	from 725,000 a year earlier, according to figures received by
	the International Sugar Organization.
	    January is the first major export month and the figures
	thus give a good indication of the current crop, they said.
	Fourth quarter exports fell to 622,000 tonnes from 909,000
	tonnes a year earlier, but this was because Cuba was destocking
	at the end of 1985, they added.
	    Trade house C Czarnikow recently estimated production this
	year at 7.50 mln tonnes.
	    Cuban sugar production in the third quarter of 1986 was
	12,000 tonnes, giving a final 1985/86 crop total of 7.35 mln
	tonnes, compared with a 1984/85 crop of 8.10 mln tonnes.
	    There is normally no third quarter production in Cuba, but
	a hurricane meant that last year's crop was extended.
	    Exports to the USSR were substantially down in January at
	362,000 tonnes from 489,000 in January 1986, but other Comecon
	countries received 210,000 tonnes, against 80,000 tonnes in the
	same month last year, figures received by the ISO show.
	    Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Romania all took
	substantially more Cuban sugar.
	    Cuba's November 1986 exports totalled 158,000 tonnes,
	compared with 190,000 tonnes in 1985, and December's total was
	237,000 tonnes, down from 518,000 tonnes the year before.
	Calendar year exports for 1986 were also lower at 6.69 mln
	tonnes against 7.21 mln in 1985 -- the lowest level since
	1980's 6.19 mln tonnes, the figures show.

	UK SUGAR FACTORY CLOSES DUE TO SHORTAGE OF BEET

	British Sugar Plc was forced to shut its
	Ipswich sugar factory on Sunday afternoon due to an acute
	shortage of beet supplies, a spokesman said, responding to a
	Reuter inquiry
	    Beet supplies have dried up at Ipswich due to a combination
	of very wet weather, which has prevented most farmers in the
	factory's catchment area from harvesting, and last week's
	hurricane which blocked roads.
	    The Ipswich factory will remain closed until roads are
	cleared and supplies of beet build up again.
	    This is the first time in many years that a factory has
	been closed in mid-campaign, the spokesman added.
	    Other factories are continuing to process beet normally,
	but harvesting remains very difficult in most areas.
	    Ipswich is one of 13 sugar factories operated by British
	Sugar. It processes in excess of 500,000 tonnes of beet a year
	out of an annual beet crop of around eight mln tonnes.
	    Despite the closure of Ipswich and the severe harvesting
	problems in other factory areas, British Sugar is maintaining
	its estimate of sugar production this campaign at around 1.2
	mln tonnes, white value, against 1.34 mln last year, the
	spokesman said.
	    British Sugar processes all sugar beet grown in the U.K.
	    The sugar beet processing campaign, which began last month,
	is expected to run until the end of January. Sugar factories
	normally work 24 hours a day, seven days a week during the
	campaign.
	    As of October 11, 12 pct of the U.K. Sugar crop had been
	harvested, little different to the same stage last year when 13
	pct had been lifted. Since then, however, very wet weather has
	severely restricted beet lifting.
	    Harvesting figures for the week to October 18 are not yet
	available.
