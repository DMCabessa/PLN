	STUDY SAYS U.S., CANADA PACT WOULD SPUR ECONOMIES

CONTENT:
	A free trade pact between the United
	States and Canada could spur the economies of both sides
	substantially, according to a study released by the Institute
	for International Economics.
	    The study, by Paul Wonnacott, said a successful conclusion
	to the free trade talks now under way could raise Canada's
	gross national product by more than five pct and expand U.S.
	export's by about seven pct.
	    He said the pact could resolve the knotty issue of
	government subsidies, end curbs on trade in services and
	investments and pave the way for new global talks under the 
	General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
	    The United States and Canada - the world's two biggest
	trading partners with cross border shipments of about 150
	billion dlrs a year - opened free trade talks last June. They
	are aiming for a pact by next October.
	    Wonnacott, an economics professor at the Univerity of
	Maryland, said an agreement should include:
	    - Elimination of tariffs between the two countries, phased
	in over a five to 10-year period;
	    - Equal access to federal government procurement in the two
	countries, replacing current "Buy America" and "Buy Canada"
	provisions with a "Buy North America" provision;
	    - Fewer restrictions in trade in services, chiefly finance
	and transportation;
	    - A commitment not to screen foreign investments in favor
	domestic producers;
	    - A commission to resolve bilateral trade disputes.
	     Wonnacott said that to resolve the subsidy problem, the
	two sides should permit export subsidies of exports of up to
	2.0 or 2.5 pct without imposing coutervailing duties.
	    The limit on subsidies is now 0.5 pct.
	    He proposed that any attempt to impose new duties to offset
	subsidies should go first a special disputes commission for
	resolution at an early stage.
	    Wonnacott said "bilateral free trade would contribute to the
	efficiency of the North American economies and to their
	competitiveness in facing overseas producers.
	    He said it would it would open U.S. markets to Canadian
	goods and enable them to benefit from the economies of mass
	production.
	    Benefits to the United States would be fewer than those to
	Canada proportionately, he said, because of the already large
	U.S. gross national product.
	    Wonnacott said also that a U.S.-Canada pact in such areas
	as export subsidies and the creation of a dispute commission
	could set an example for the current attempt by GATT to write
	new and more liberal global trading regulations.

	The Agriculture Ministry declined comment
	on a local newspaper report that Japan had agreed to hold talks
	on its closed rice market in the new GATT round.

	    Nihon Keizai Shinbun, quoting unnamed government sources,

	    The U.S. Has been pressing Japan to discuss the rice issue
	at the new round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade

	    Imports of rice to Japan are banned under the Foodstuff

	    Nihon Keizai said Japan's plan resulted from worries about
	mounting trade tension with the U.S. At the GATT talks, Japan

	GATT WARNS U.S. ON FEDERAL BUDGET, PROTECTIONISM
TOPICS:
	trade
PLACES:
	switzerland, usa, west-germany, japan
CONTENT:
	The United States' emphasis on its
	foreign trade deficit is misplaced and the country's real
	problem lies in its large federal budget deficit, the General
	Agreeement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) said.
	     By stressing its record trade deficit of 169.8 billion
	dlrs last year, the U.S. Was fuelling protectionist pressure
	which threatens the world trading system, it said in an annual
	report.
	    The fundamental problem, the size of the U.S. Federal
	budget deficit, could be remedied only by cutting government
	spending or encouraging personal savings to finance the debt,
	it said.
	    GATT also predicted world trade would grow by only 2.5 pct
	in 1987 -- a full percentage point lower than in each of the
	previous two years.
	    GATT experts urged Washington to resist protectionism and
	instead seek macroeconomic changes to reduce the current
	account payments deficit -- higher private savings, lower
	investment and a smaller federal budget deficit.
	    Raising U.S. Trade barriers "would result in little or no
	reduction in the current account deficit. It would, however,
	increase inflation and reduce world trade," it said.
	    "The basic cause -- some combination of insufficient
	domestic savings and an excessive budget deficit -- would
	remain," the report said.
	    GATT economists said trade expansion would slow this year
	because of slower growth forecasts in Japan and some West
	European nations as they adjust production and workforces to a
	low dollar, risk of higher U.S. Inflation, concerns over Third
	World debt management and looming protectionism.
	    The report also said imbalances in the current accounts of
	Japan, West Germany and the U.S. Had increased in 1986.
	    The most likely explanation was that exchange rate changes
	were not backed by changes in macroeconomic policies, it added.
	    "Thus the prediction that these imbalances would be reduced
	as a result of the major realignment of exchange rates was not
	borne out last year," the report said.
	    GATT warned there was a risk of a sizeable increase in the
	U.S. Inflation rate under the combined impact of a rapidly
	expanding money supply and low dollar.
	    "Such a development could worsen the business climate by
	increasing uncertainty and pushing up interest rates, which, in
	turn, would adversely affect world trade."
	    But the report noted a surprising rise in imports to the
	United States, despite the dollar's depreciation which makes
	foreign products more expensive.
	    It suggested that resources idle in the U.S., Both human
	and in underutilised factories, were not geared to produce the
	goods and services sought from abroad.
	    World trade in manufactures grew by only three pct in 1986,
	about half of the rate of the previous year.
	    Trade in agricultural goods expanded by just one pct,
	continuing a stagnant pattern in that sector this decade, GATT
	said.
	    Developing countries' exports declined significantly, while
	their imports increased moderately, although full statistics
	are not available yet, GATT said.
	    The combined export earnings of 16 major indebted nations
	were sharply lower, and only five of them (Chile, Colombia,
	Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand) had higher exports.

	GATT ROUND MAY STOP GROWING TRADE PROBLEMS: U.S.

CONTENT:
	A successful new GATT
	(General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) round is needed to
	halt growing bilateral trade problems between major trading
	partners, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said.
	    Yeutter, in New Zealand for informal GATT ministerial
	talks, told Reuters bilateral trade disputes are increasing
	because the multilateral system is inefficient.
	    "That is really a strong rationale why we need a new GATT
	round," he said. "The very existence of all these bilateral
	irritants clearly emphasises the need to develop multilateral
	solutions to some of these problems."
	    The eighth GATT round of negotiations was launched at Punta
	del Este in Uruguay in September 1986. Agriculture and services
	were included in the negotiations for the first time.
	    The growing debt burden of Latin American and African
	nations will also provide impetus for the GATT round to
	succeed, he said. "Clearly those countries need to develop their
	export endeavours and they need open markets for that to happen
	and that's the basic objective of the new GATT round."
	    But he said the GATT round is a long term endeavour. It
	will not give any short term relief for debt ridden countries,
	but it will make a difference in 10 to 15 years.
	    "It's a worthwhile activity from their standpoint because
	these debts are not going to go away in the next year or two,"
	he said.
	    "They ought to be very strongly supported in the GATT round
	as a mechanism for relieving their debt burdens or making
	possible debt amortisation in the future," he said.

	CHINA LIKELY TO JOIN GATT, DIPLOMATS SAY
TOPICS:
	
PLACES:
	china
CONTENT:
	China is likely to succeed in joining
	GATT despite policies that contradict free trade, because
	western countries support its entry, western diplomats said.
	    China applied to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and
	Trade (GATT) in July 1986. The organisation, formed in 1948 to
	integrate the world's free market economies, now regulates 80
	pct of world trade.
	    The GATT secretariat is expected to submit a list of
	detailed questions to China next month at the start of long and
	complex entry negotiations, the diplomats said.
	    One diplomat said China's prospects are good, with its
	application supported by the United States, Japan and the
	European Community for political and economic reasons.
	    "The fear is that if China was refused entry, it would draw
	back the bamboo curtain and go back to the way it was," he said.
	    Another said the Soviet Union was waiting in the wings.
	    "If GATT accepted China, it would be hard not to accept the
	Soviet Union," he said.
	    "China's agreement will be seen as a model for the Soviet
	Union. GATT is not a political body."
	    But serious problems have to be tackled during the talks,
	including China's pricing system and trade subsidies.
	    GATT is based on free trade and aims to lower tariffs and
	promote trade, with prices alone dictating who buys what.
	    One diplomat said it was very hard in China to establish
	the real cost of goods because many prices are set by the state
	and often contain subsidies.
	    "Even when you go in person to a factory or a company to try
	to find out the real cost of something, officials do not give
	you a clear answer. The political meaning is evident. They do
	not want to answer," he said.
	    China's position, as set out in a memorandum to GATT in
	February, is that it is gradually reforming its price system to
	bring prices in line with real production costs and replace
	administrative controls with market ones.
	    Another diplomat said countries with centralised economies
	such as Hungary and Yugoslavia had joined GATT. However, China
	would not apply for membership on similar terms, but rather as
	a less developed country entitled to preferential treatment.
	    He added that the economies of Hungary and Yugoslavia are
	small, while China's is huge and its weight would be felt.
	    "It (China) is the world's number two producer of coal, for
	instance," the diplomat said. "It could have a very large impact
	on world trade."
	    Another sticking point is the subsidies China pays its
	companies to export so it can earn foreign exchange to pay for
	vitally needed technology, equipment and raw materials.
	    A Japanese trader said China lost money on every tonne of
	grain it exported, because it had to make up the difference
	between a low world price and a high domestic price.
	    A western diplomat said an official of a foreign trade
	bureau of a major inland Chinese city told him export subsidies
	might be as high as 100 pct for some products.
	    "When I asked what the subsidy figure was for the whole
	country, he referred me to the Ministry of Finance, adding with
	a grin that they would not tell me," he said.
	    He said officials were unwilling to give figures because of
	the sensitivity of the subject.
	    "Unless something is done to change this, China will find
	many countries in GATT putting restrictions on imports from
	China," the diplomat added.
	    In a major speech on the economy late last month, Planning
	Minister Song Ping made an indirect reference to this problem.
	    "While trying to expand exports to earn more foreign
	exchange, we must improve economic accounting practices and
	reduce the cost of exports," he said.
	    One diplomat said China's freedom to change its foreign
	trade and pricing system to bring them more in line with GATT
	principles could conflict with domestic pressures. China has
	said there will be no major price reforms this year following
	widespread discontent in 1985 and 1986 from a public used to
	stable prices since the Communist takeover in 1949.
	    "So the question is how fast and how thoroughly can China
	reform its economy?," the diplomat said. "How can it balance the
	requirements of GATT membership with domestic political needs?"
	    But he added the advantages of China's entry would in the
	end outweigh these problems.
	    "China's entry would force it to modernise and become more a
	part of the world economy," he said.
	    "Just as China would get increased access to foreign
	markets, so it would have to give more access to its domestic
	market to foreign countries."

	INDIA STEPS UP COUNTERTRADE DEALS TO CUT TRADE GAP
TOPICS:

PLACES:
	india, ussr, south-korea
CONTENT:
	India is searching for non-communist
	countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and
	conserve foreign exchange.
	    Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering and
	electronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, are
	all on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products,
	chemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told Reuters.
	    Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in
	1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the State Trading
	Corp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC).
	    "The two state trading corporations are free to use their
	buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian
	exports," a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding that
	private firms are excluded from countertrading.
	    One trade source said India has targetted countries that
	depend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreign
	imports.
	    However, countertrade deals still make up only a small part
	of India's total trading and are likely to account for less
	than eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in trade
	during the nine months ended December, the sources said.
	    Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India's 25.65
	billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March,
	against almost nothing in 1984/85, official figures show.
	    However, the figures exclude exchanges with the Eastern
	Bloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees, the sources said.
	    Total trade with the Soviet Union, involving swaps of
	agricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crude
	oil, is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87,
	against three billion in 1985/86.
	    Indian countertrade, which is being promoted mainly to help
	narrow the country's large trade deficit, is still
	insignificant compared with agreements reached by Indonesia,
	Venezuela and Brazil, the trade sources said.
	    The trade deficit, which hit an estimated record 6.96
	billion dlrs in 1985/86, is expected to decline to 5.6 billion
	in the current fiscal year.
	    But the push to include non-communist countries in
	countertrade is also due to other factors, including the slow
	growth of foreign reserves, a tight debt repayment schedule,
	shrinking aid and trade protectionism, businessmen said.
	    One source said India is showing more dynamism in promoting
	countertrade deals than in the past, when the deals were made
	discreetly because they break GATT rules. As a member of the
	General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), India cannot
	officially support bartering.
	    The MMTC's recent countertrade deals include iron ore
	exports to Yugoslavia for steel structures and rails.
	    "MMTC's recent global tenders now include a clause that
	preference will be given to parties who accept payment in kind
	for goods and services sold to India," a trade official said,
	adding that the policy remains flexible.
	    "We also take into account other factors such as prices at
	which the goods and services are offered to India," the trade
	official said.
	    Early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreign
	companies interested in selling aircraft, ships, drilling rigs
	and railway equipment to India that they stood a better chance
	if they bought Indian goods or services in return, the trade
	sources said.
	    Illustrating the point, the official said a South Korean
	firm recently agreed to sell a drilling platform worth 40 mln
	dlrs to the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Commission.
	    In return, the South Koreans gave a verbal assurance to buy
	Indian goods worth 10 pct of the contract, against the 25 pct
	sought by New Delhi, the trade official said.
	    "We selected the Korean firm because its bid was the lowest,"
	he added.
	    Countertrade is helping African countries short of foreign
	currency to import goods. India has signed a trade protocol to
	buy up to 15,000 tonnes of asbestos fibre from Zimbabwe in
	exchange for Indian goods, including jute bags and cars.
	    But despite India's new drive, countertrade has some
	inherent problems, they added.
	    "It is not always easy to meet the basic requirement that
	the trade should always be balanced," one trade source said. "The
	other problem is it is often difficult to supply or buy
	commodities which the other party wants."
	    Another added, "Barter is also restrictive. We look upon it
	as a temporary measure to get over the current balance of
	payments difficulty.
	    "This is why countertrade has not been made a law in India.
	It does not even figure in the country's foreign trade policy."

	Japan should increase foreign access to

	    The white paper on agriculture for the year ended March 31
	said active participation in writing world farm trade rules at
	the next round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)
	talks will help prepare Japan to improve access.
	    Agriculture Ministry sources said the paper marked an
	easing in Japan's tough position on agricultural imports which
	stressed the need for strict controls on some products to
	maintain self-sufficiency in food.
	    Japan now produces only 30 pct of its annual grain needs,
	down from 61 pct some 20 years ago, official figures show.
	    The paper said Japanese agriculture has been slow to
	improve productivity and demand/supply imbalances.
	    The relative shortage of farmland in Japan is mainly
	responsible for higher domestic prices, it said.
	    The strong yen has meant lower input material prices but
	has also resulted in higher agricultural imports which has
	worsened working conditions among part-time farmers, the paper
	said.
	    This could make it difficult to improve the industry's
	structure, the paper said.
	    To solve these problems and to reduce farm product prices
	to more reasonable levels, Japan should try to restructure the

CONTENT:
	The European Community (EC) agreed a
	trade deal with Argentina designed to compensate the country
	following the entry of Spain and Portugal into the group, EC
	officials said.
	    Under the deal agreed by EC foreign ministers, Argentina
	will gain additional trading rights on a series of products
	including meat, fish and cereals by-products.
	    But ministers failed to agree on new trade deals with
	Canada and Japan and are due to study these again, the
	officials said.
	    The deal with Argentina was agreed by a majority of EC
	states after West Germany withdrew objections to increased
	quotas for Argentina on high-quality beef.
	    Ireland and France continued to oppose the deal on meat,
	saying that the main dispute was over sales of cereals
	substitutes, but they were outvoted by the other states, the
	officials said. Under the deal, Argentina will benefit from
	improved quotas on exports of beef to the EC. In particular the
	quota on high-quality Hilton beef will be raised by 4,500
	tonnes to 34,300 tonnes and quotas on frozen boneless beef will
	be increased by 3,000 tonnes to 53,000 tonnes.
	    Argentina will also benefit from an additional quota of
	5,000 tonnes of frozen hake fillets at 10 pct duty and reduced
	levies on 550,000 tonnes of wheat bran, the officials said.
	    The improved trade terms were offered after Argentina said
	that Spain and Portugal's entry into the EC affected their
	exports of cereals substitutes to these two countries. They
	have been negotiated under the rules of GATT (General Agreement
	on Tariffs and Trade).
	    But officials said ministers had been unable to resolve
	Canadian claims that its sales of certain fish to Spain had
	been affected by the country's EC membership.
	    Officials said the EC had asked GATT to arbitrate on the
	fish dispute with Canada.
	    Ministers also decided to continue talks with Japan. The EC
	claims that Spain and Portugal's entry into the group has
	improved trade conditions for Japan but has been unsatisfied
	with Japanese offers of compensation.
	    Japan's main offers were to improve inspection systems on
	citrus fruits to aid EC exports, to improve tariffs for some
	other farm produce, to increase tariffs for leather footwear
	and to offer better trade terms for Spain and Portugal.
	    EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq told
	journalists: "We maintain our position that the (Japanese)
	concessions were not enough."
	    "We hope that there will be an improvement," he said.

	FEW EXPECT NEW ECONOMIC INITIATIVES IN VENICE
TOPICS:

CONTENT:
	The Venice summit on June 8-10 is likely
	to disappoint those hoping for new policies to whip up flagging
	world growth, according to officials from summit countries.
	    Worries over protectionist threats and the Third World debt
	crisis are also unlikely to be assuaged, they added.
	    The talks may yield agreed statements on the military
	situation in the Gulf, co-operation in the fight against the
	killer disease AIDS or on East-West relations, they said.
	    But most summit participants have made it clear that major
	new initiatives on economic issues must not be expected.
	    West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said in a recent
	interview that "the translation of previous announcements into
	policy is more important than new declarations and commitments."
	    The main goal at the summit would be to strengthen existing
	agreements to secure steady medium term growth and avoid "the
	danger of a further devaluation of the dollar" via close
	co-operation on economic and financial policies, Kohl added.
	    Critics challenged this view. They pointed to the worrying
	background of slower growth, especially in Japan and Germany,
	amid fears about a pickup in inflation in the U.S. Which could
	lead to higher interest rates and exacerbate the debt crisis.
	    The marginal impact that the major shifts in dollar, yen
	and mark exchange rates have had on the Japanese and German
	trade surpluses and U.S. Trade and fiscal deficits since the
	September 1985 Plaza agreement was also a cause for concern.
	    Economists said the recent rise in the dollar was likely to
	be quickly reversed in the absence of new commitments in
	Venice.
	    But government officials do not expect summit delegations -
	from the U.S., Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy, Canada
	and the European Community - to go much beyond restating policy
	goals enshrined in the February Louvre agreement of Group of
	Seven finance ministers and central bankers.
	    Under the agreement, aimed at halting the dollar's 20-month
	decline and at fostering balanced growth, Japan and West
	Germany would work to eliminate their trade and payments
	surpluses in return for a U.S. Pledge to reduce fiscal
	deficits.
	    A 6,000 billion yen package announced by Prime Minister
	Yasuhiro Nakasone last week went some way towards that goal and
	appeared to have saved Japan from a widely anticipated summit
	attack on its economic policies, officials said.
	    The package, featuring government spending and tax cuts to
	stimulate demand, drew a cautious welcome in European capitals
	but its reception in the U.S. Was much more enthusiastic.
	    Treasury Secretary James Baker commented, "Of course,
	implementation is the key, but this is clearly forward movement
	toward fulfillment by Japan of its commitments."
	    With Japan signalling its willingness to boost domestic
	demand rather than rely on exports for growth, the U.S. And
	other summit countries were now set to shift their attention to
	West Germany and press Kohl for similar action, officials said.
	    U.S. Assistant treasury secretary David Mulford said there
	was worldwide concern that German economic growth has flagged,
	and the U.S. Would demand that Kohl confirm a commitment that
	policies would be reviewed if growth continued sluggish.
	    But West German officials said Kohl would fiercely resist
	any such pressure. One senior Bonn official said, "There is just
	no room for manoeuvre for any economic moves."
	    Finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg has problems finding
	cash to finance tax cuts promised for 1990, and is reluctantly
	letting government borrowing rise, Bonn officials said.
	    Citing fierce opposition by West Germany and Britain,
	European officials also ruled out progress on U.S. Plans for a
	more formal strategy for coordinating economic policies, based
	on a series of economic indicators.
	    The U.S. Wants other Group of Seven countries to agree to
	high level consultations when the indicators, including trade,
	growth, interest and exchange rates, inflation and fiscal
	deficits, show members are not living up to economic
	commitments.
	  But Germany and Britain fear the plan would undermine
	economic sovereignty, and Britain also feels the proposals are
	too complicated and too rigid, officials said.
	    Recent developments on Third World debt, including moves by
	two of the largest U.S. Banks to set aside billions of dollars
	to cover bad loans, will feature prominently in the talks.
	    U.S. And Japanese officials said they would seek to
	reactivate the Baker initiative at the summit and renew a call
	to commercial banks to come up with a "menu of alternatives" to
	restore some new bank lending to debtor countries.
	    Officials said there was also scope for agreement on a
	Franco-British plan aimed at alleviating the burden for the
	world's poorest debtor countries through concessional
	rescheduling of their sovereign debt at the Paris Club.
	    The talks would also include plans to dismantle runaway
	farm subsidies all summit nations pay to guarantee the income
	of their farmers and secure a share of world markets, they

	    The 24 members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation

	    "What we want is not for treasuries to compete as they do
	now. We want to see to it that our farmers will be able to
	compete in international markets," Canadian Prime Minister Brian
	Mulroney said.
	    The U.S. Intends to table specific proposals on the issue
	at GATT, the world trade body, immediately after the summit to
	signal that it wants negotiations on farm trade to take
	precedence over the other trade issues included in the new GATT
	round of talks launched last year in Punta del Este, Uruguay.
	    "We won't have much tolerance for delay," U.S. Agriculture

	Ministers from more than 20
	nations were told by New Zealand that the next international
	negotiations on liberalising trade would be the last this
	century and the cost of failure could not be measured.
	    Trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues at a
	welcoming ceremony before two days of talks here that great
	progress had been made in preparing for the negotiations which
	must not be sidetracked.
	    "We live in troubled and dangerous times for the world
	trading system," he said.
	    "We have seen that the failure of the world trading system
	has caused great depression and conflict in the past. Our
	failure to maintain the momentum will be at great cost to us
	all," Moore said.
	   "The cost of failure is beyond calculation. It is our last
	hope and best opportunity this century. We will not get another
	chance before the year 2000," he added.
	    The ministers are in New Zealand to review world trade
	since the "Uruguay round" talks last September. The talks are 
	also part of preparations for a full-scale June meeting of the
	General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Venice.
	    The Uruguay meeting is considered by most countries to have
	been particularly successful, with northern hemisphere
	countries managing to have service industries such as banking
	and insurance included in the next full round.
	    The southerners' goal of including agricultural and
	tropical products also was met.
	    The meeting at this North Island tourist resort is
	described by participants as informal and no declaration is
	expected.
	    Moore said one aim was to "instil a sense of political
	urgency to avert potential economic tragedy."
	    Another was to seek ways of popularising freer trade to
	people who felt the pain of readjustment but could not see the
	benefits, as well as preventing "bush fires of confrontation
	while we proceed with orderly negotiations."
	    The meeting is being attended by 25 overseas delegations
	including representatives of GATT and the Economic Community.
	    The delegates include U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
	Yeutter.
	    American sources say he is ready to state that the best way
	to reverse protectionist sentiment in the United States is to
	implement four key Uruguay proposals:
	    -- an end to agricultural subsidies;
	    -- inclusion of trade in services and investments in GATT
	regulations;
	    -- tightening of restrictions on pirating of so-called
	intellectual property such as trademarks, patents and
	copyrights;
	    -- new rules to resolve trade disputes among GATT's 92
	member states.

	DRESDNER BANK UNIT SAYS NOT WORRIED ON BRAZIL DEBT
TOPICS:

	west-germany, brazil, mexico
CONTENT:
	Deutsch-Suedamerikanische Bank AG, a
	wholly owned subsidiary of Dresdner Bank AG <DRSD.F>, said it
	was not worried about Brazil stopping its interest payments.
	    Board member Herbert Mittendorf told a news conference that
	Brazil's example was unlikely to be followed by other Latin
	American countries.
	    He pointed out that the region's debt rose by only 2.8 pct
	last year to a total 396 billion dlrs. The countries' efforts
	to further economic growth and to consolidate budgets were "not
	unsuccessful." But the slump in oil prices and the decline in
	commodity prices hampered these efforts, he said.
	    Latin American countries' exports fell last year by about
	16 pct to 80 billion dlrs, with imports declining slightly to
	around 65 billion dlrs, Mittendorf said.
	    The region's 1986 trade surplus was halved to an estimated
	15 billion dlrs, he said. The cut in exchange earnings of oil
	exporting countries was only partly offset by the advantages
	gained by the region's oil importing states, he noted.
	    The region's principal debtors are Brazil and Mexico, each
	owing about 100 billion dlrs at the end of last year, followed
	by Argentina with around 49 billion dlrs, Venezuela with 33
	billion and Chile with 20 billion dlrs debt.
	    Deutsch-Suedamerikanische Bank welcomed Mexico joining the
	General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in mid 1986,
	which it saw as an effort to integrate the country to a larger
	extent into the world economy.
	    However, realistic exchange rates were needed if the debtor
	countries were to compete in the world market, Mittendorf said.
	    In this respect an easing of protectionist barriers was
	imperative, he said.
	    The conversion of debt into equity was regarded as an
	important additional step towards debt consolidation.
	    West German exports to Latin America declined by 4.1 pct in
	1986 to 11 billion marks. Shipments to Mexico fell 19 pct to
	1.9 billion marks and to Colombia by 15 pct to 600 mln marks,
	Mittendorf said.
	    Exports to Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador and Central America were
	also lower last year than in 1985, while shipments to Brazil
	rose 11.5 pct to around two billion marks. Exports to Argentina
	went up by over three pct to 1.5 billion marks and those to
	Paraguay surged by 42 pct to 106 mln marks, he said.
	    Brazil was West Germany's main Latin American supplier, but
	shipments fell to 4.4 billion marks from 6.4 billion in 1985.

	LATIN DEBTORS MAKE NEW PUSH FOR DEBT RELIEF
TOPICS:
	
PLACES:
	mexico
CONTENT:
	Rising interest rates and
	protectionist trade policies had prompted a new push by Latin
	American nations to win debt relief, regional foreign and
	finance ministry officials said here.
	    Officials of the Cartagena group of 11 debtor nations met
	here this week to draw up new proposals in reaction to what
	they called a deteriorating world panorama, and Citicorp's
	decision to create reserves against third world loans.
	    (SEE ECRA FOR SPOTLIGHT HEADLINES)
	    "We are looking at trade, interest rates and financial
	flows.....In order to put forward a basis for some permanent
	solutions," Mexico's public credit director Angel Gurria said.
	    Recent developments have led to moves for a summit of Latin
	American presidents and debate on new solutions.
	    Ideas include schemes to link debt payments to trade, and
	proposals for stable interest rates. The latter was proposed in
	a letter this week from Cartagena to G-7 leaders who are due to
	attend a summit in Venice this month.
	    Another idea is to include debt under Gatt negotiations,
	but Cartegena ministers have yet to endorse any proposals.
	    Speaking earlier in New York, Uruguay's Foreign Minister
	and Cartagena group chairman Enrique Iglesias said Citicorp's
	decision could discourage new lending. But it might help
	Cartagena's bid to have old and new debt treated separately.
	    The Cartagena group, which has not met at ministerial level
	for over a year, wants to repay debt contracted before the debt
	crisis at the low interest rates prevailing in the 1970s. It
	would pay new loans at current market rates.
	    "Many countries fear that what they have gained in months of
	arduous debt negotiations they can lose at a stroke with a one
	point rise in interest rates," one official here said.
	    "The new increase in interest rates has come precisely when
	we thought they had still not come down enough," Iglesias said.
	    Latin American officials are also concerned that varying
	interest spreads granted to different debtor nations could
	generate discord, as with the Philippines' recent protest at
	being given less favourable terms than Argentina.
	    There has been speculation Venezuela would demand a cut in
	its 7/8 pct spread, but public finances director Jorge Marcano
	said here there were no plans to renegotiate terms.
	    This week's meeting came after three Latin American
	presidents meeting in Montevideo called for stable interest
	rates on the region's 380 billion dlr foreign debt. It was
	called to review developments since the last ministerial
	meeting in February 1986 and to think up new ideas.
	    Since the last ministerial meeting there have been some
	advances, such as Mexico's growth-oriented 77 billion dlr loan
	and refinancing package agreed last September. But there have
	also been setbacks, like Brazil's payments moratorium.
	    The loans expected in the Baker plan have not materialized
	and debtors have been forced to browbeat reluctant banks.
	    "We have clearly stretched the restructuring process to its
	limits and and the question is now where do we go from here?" a
	senior Mexican foreign ministry official said.
	    Existing debt strategy has been based on nursing debtor
	economies back to a position where they can again service their
	debts and qualify for new loans.
	    But after five years of economic adjustment, Latin American
	debtors are currently unable to raise voluntary credits, with
	the exception of Colombia. Only Venezuela is paying back
	principal. Most countries have no prospect of paying their
	debts in the foreseeable future.
	    Citicorp has made clear its decision to move three billion
	dlrs to reserves does not mean it is writing-off the loans.
	    Latin American officials here said Citicorp's move would
	probably boost trading of discounted third world debt in the
	secondary market, implicitly downvaluing the amount owed. But
	they said it might make new lending even more remote.
	    Discounted debt can be bought by foreign investors through
	debt-equity schemes that generate new resources for debtor
	economies. Chile and Mexico are currently front-runners in this
	field, but most Latin American officials see these schemes as
	limited and no panacea for the overall problem.
	    Most Latin officials set greater store on building up
	export income than on debt-equity schemes.
	    Exports hit 97.7 billion dlrs in 1984, cutting the region's
	debt service ratio to 36 pct, but they fell to 78.3 billion
	last year. So, even though interest rates had dropped the ratio
	hardly changed.
	    The Cartagena group has called for the debt-trade link to
	be recognized before, but has not made detailed proposals.
	    Officials said initiatives discussed here would be
	submitted to foreign and finance ministers of the 11 nations,
	before IMF and World Bank annual meetings later this year.

	The world trade body GATT has decided to

	    Canada and the EC told a GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs

	an ad valorem basis on imports as of December 1, 1986, is
	illegal under GATT rules.
	    U.S. Ambassador Michael Samuels said the fee, imposed by
	the U.S. To help cover customs expenditure as part of the
	Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, does
	not breach GATT rules and is similar to fees charged by many
	other countries.
	    Samuels suggested that a working party be set up to examine

	The European Community (EC) has
	warned the U.S. House of Representatives that tough trade
	legislation it is considering could prompt retaliation by U.S.
	trading partners.
	    The warning was sent in a letter from Sir Roy Denman, head
	of the EC delegation in Washington, to Dan Rostenkowski,
	chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
	    A copy of the letter was made available to Reuters.
	    Denman told Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat, he backed
	aspects of the bill, such as one backing new talks under the
	GATT and one excluding protection for the textile industry.
	    But Denman disagreed with other provisions which would
	require President Reagan to take retaliatory trade action
	against nations with large trade surpluses with the U.S. and
	would set new standards for judging unfair foreign trade
	practices.
	    Denman told Rostenkowski that GATT regulations prohibit
	member nations from taking unilateral retaliatory action in
	trade disputes unless the action is GATT-approved.
	    He said "If the Congress makes retaliatory action mandatory,
	then the United States would be in violation of its
	international legal obligations and on a collision course with
	its major trading partners."
	    Denman added that a president should have flexibility in
	enforcing trade laws, saying "in the last resort, any
	administration must take its decision in light of the overall
	national interest."
	    Otherwise, he said, "the risk would be counter-reaction by
	trading partners of the United States, i.e., retaliation or
	enactment of mirror image legislation to be employed against
	imports from the United States."
	    Denman also said Congress could prompt retaliation if it
	reduced the threshhold of unfair trade by making it easier for
	firms to file unfair trade practice claims.
	    Retaliation could also be prompted by relaxing standards
	for findings that imports were injuring U.S. firms.
	    "Changes in these standards must be agreed upon
	multilaterally. They cannot be imposed by the United States
	alone on the world trading system," he said.
	    House leaders have rejected a plan by textile-state
	legislators to add to the trade bill a provision to curb
	imports of cloth and clothing, similar to a measure passed two
	years ago but vetoed by President Reagan.
	    There was concern by the leaders that Reagan would veto the
	entire trade bill because of the textile amendment.

	The United States has appealed for

	    The call by U.S. Deputy Trade Representative Michael Smith
	at a special committee meeting into the future of GATT follows
	a series of bilateral trade rows which have clouded efforts by
	the 93-nation body to promote fair trade.
	    Today's meeting was part of the Uruguay trade round
	launched by ministers last September. The round, which covers
	13 areas of trade in agriculture, manufactured goods and
	services will take four years to negotiate.
	    Smith called for boosting GATT's links with financial
	institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and World
	Bank. He also urged greater involvement of trade ministers to
	ensure the success of the Uruguay Round.
	    "The GATT as an institution needs to be strengthened to
	assure that the GATT plays its proper role in management of the
	world trading system and the global economy," Smith said.
	    "Rules can and will be ignored if the institution is weak,
	or perceived as unable to adapt to the changing world economy."
	    He also also urged that member states be accountable to
	each other for their trade policies.
	    Smith, who flies to Brussels today for talks with European
	Community (EC) officials, told Reuters the committee wanted to
	stress GATT's importance and did not discuss specifics.
	    "We are interested in more periodic ministerial
	involvement...Whether in formal or informal meetings," he said.
	    GATT's ruling council is due to hear a complaint from the
	12-nation EC on April 15 about the U.S.-Japanese accord on
	semiconductors. The EC charges the accord breached GATT trade
	rules by allowing Tokyo to set minimum prices for Japanese
	chips sold in third countries and is requesting a GATT dispute
	panel be set up to review the agreement.
	    President Reagan, who strongly supported the Uruguay trade
	round to promote freer trade, has said Washington will impose
	tariffs against Japanese electronic goods.
	    He said Tokyo had not shown willingness to open its markets

	    Willy de Clercq, External Relations Commissioner of the

	    China formally applied to join GATT in July 1986 and in

	De Clercq said was now being studied. Questions would then be
	presented to China.
	    "After China, other important state-trading countries
	including the Soviet Union, will probably demand accession.
	China's application could be considered a test case," he said.
	    He said the EC strongly backed China's application, but
	others among GATT's 92 contracting parties took a tougher line.
	    Among the numerous problems of a huge centrally-run economy
	entering a free trade system are tariffs and reciprocity and
	the expectation that China will practice an open-trade policy
	without trade discrimination, de Clercq added.
	    De Clercq noted the different dimensions of the Chinese
	economy and those of Hungary and Yugoslavia, the two current
	Socialist GATT members.
	    On China's import potential, he said a foreign exchange
	shortage would force China to import less this year and next

	Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) because it discriminated
	against imported products in favour of domestically-produced
	goods.
	    The Commission said it would ask Geneva-based GATT to rule
	on whether the section in question, which officials said had
	proved a barrier to many EC exporters, conformed to its rules.
	    Commission officials did not rule out retaliatory measures
	if, after a GATT decision against it, Washington failed to
	bring the disputed section into line with international rules.
	    The executive's decision to go to GATT follows a complaint
	to it by the Dutch company Akzo <AKZO.AS>, whose "aramid"
	synthetic fibres have been banned from the U.S. Market because
	of charges by the U.S. Firm <Dupont> that the fibres violate
	the American company's patents.
	    Akzo alleged that the ban, imposed by the U.S.
	International Trade Commission (ITC), was discriminatory and
	incompatible with GATT provisions.
	    The dispute centres on the fact that section 337 of the
	U.S. Tariff Act gives the ITC jurisdiction  over imported
	products. The EC Commission charged that EC producers did not
	have the same possibilities for defending themselves before the
	ITC as they would have in a normal U.S. Court.
	    "Consequently the procedure followed...Is less favourable
	than that which takes places in normal courts of law for goods
	produced in the United States," it said in a statement.

	    EC foreign ministers meeting here issued a statement
	deploring Japan's continued trade imbalance and appealed for

	    Ministers also issued a statement saying they were

	    EC External Trade Commissioner, Willy De Clercq has already

	    The ministers' said they were "very disturbed" by the U.S.

	    In a separate statement on Japan, the EC ministers said
	they "deplore the continued aggravation of the imbalance in

	    The statement added that the EC continued to insist that
	the Japanese government must boost imports and stimulate

	    Ministers also called on the European Commission to prepare
	a report on U.S.-Japanese trade for July this year to enable

	    One diplomat said the call for a report showed ministers
	were determined not to let the Japanese question drop. "It wil

	    De Clercq told journalists, "There is a certain nervousness,
	a growing impatience within the Community on trade relations

	The U.S. Will pursue its complaint that
	European governments unfairly subsidise the Airbus Industrie
	aircraft consortium in proceedings at the GATT civil aircraft

	    The U.S. Presented its case for the first time to the
	aircraft committee of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
	Trade (GATT) during a special two-day session ending today.
	GATT rules cover some 80 pct of world commerce.
	    The 20-member committee agreed to open debate on the U.S.
	Complaint, starting with informal consultations and then
	holding a special session in July, trade officials said.
	    "The tension has eased," the permanent trade ambassador of
	the 12-member European Community Tran Van Thinh told reporters.
	"The U.S. Has decided to go through proper channels."
	    U.S. Trade officials again made clear their anger over what
	they call unfair government support for Airbus, voiced during a
	visit to European capitals in February.
	    In a letter calling for the special committee meeting,
	Washington charged France, West Germany, the U.K., Spain and
	the EC Commission with unfair practices on behalf of Airbus.
	    The U.S. Charges that the Europeans are violating rules
	laid down in the 1979 Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft.
	    Washington presented its reading of rules on inducement to
	purchase aircraft and support for development of airlines
	during the special session and asked the committee to confirm
	its view.
	    Official sources in the delegations said the U.S. Views
	would be considered during the informal consultations but the
	Europeans would also be free to bring up any complaints against
	American civil aircraft practices.
	    Some delegates said the U.S. Position appeared to give such
	broad interpretation to the rules as to suggest that the civil
	aircraft accord needed re-negotiating. All these matters would

	INDIA STEPS UP COUNTERTRADE DEALS TO CUT TRADE GAP
TOPICS:

CONTENT:
	India is searching for non-communist
	countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and
	conserve foreign exchange.
	    Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering and
	electronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, are
	all on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products,
	chemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told Reuters.
	    Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in
	1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the State Trading
	Corp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC).
	    "The two state trading corporations are free to use their
	buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian
	exports," a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding that
	private firms are excluded from countertrading.
	    One trade source said India has targetted countries that
	depend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreign
	imports.
	    However, countertrade deals still make up only a small part
	of India's total trading and are likely to account for less
	than eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in trade
	during the nine months ended December, the sources said.
	    Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India's 25.65
	billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March,
	against almost nothing in 1984/85, official figures show.
	    However, the figures exclude exchanges with the Eastern
	Bloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees, the sources said.
	    Total trade with the Soviet Union, involving swaps of
	agricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crude
	oil, is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87,
	against three billion in 1985/86.
	    Indian countertrade, which is being promoted mainly to help
	narrow the country's large trade deficit, is still
	insignificant compared with agreements reached by Indonesia,
	Venezuela and Brazil, the trade sources said.
	    The trade deficit, which hit an estimated record 6.96
	billion dlrs in 1985/86, is expected to decline to 5.6 billion
	in the current fiscal year.
	    But the push to include non-communist countries in
	countertrade is also due to other factors, including the slow
	growth of foreign reserves, a tight debt repayment schedule,
	shrinking aid and trade protectionism, businessmen said.
	    One source said India is showing more dynamism in promoting
	countertrade deals than in the past, when the deals were made
	discreetly because they break GATT rules. As a member of the
	General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), India cannot
	officially support bartering.
	    The MMTC's recent countertrade deals include iron ore
	exports to Yugoslavia for steel structures and rails.
	    "MMTC's recent global tenders now include a clause that
	preference will be given to parties who accept payment in kind
	for goods and services sold to India," a trade official said,
	adding that the policy remains flexible.
	    "We also take into account other factors such as prices at
	which the goods and services are offered to India," the trade
	official said.
	    Early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreign
	companies interested in selling aircraft, ships, drilling rigs
	and railway equipment to India that they stood a better chance
	if they bought Indian goods or services in return, the trade
	sources said.
	    Illustrating the point, the official said a South Korean
	firm recently agreed to sell a drilling platform worth 40 mln
	dlrs to the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Commission.

	The European Community has told
	Congress that if textile legislation injuring EC interests is

	against U.S. exports.
	    Roy Denmam, head of the EC delegation here, issued the
	warning in a letter to Senator Lloyd Bentsen, chairman of the
	Finance Committee. A copy of the letter was provided Reuters.
	    Denmam told Bentsen, a Texas Democrat, that if the textile
	legislation passed on its own or was included in an omnibus
	trade bill and injured EC interests, "there should be no doubt
	that the EC will retaliate against the United States."
	    He added that "at a time when U.S. textile exports to the EC
	are growing rapidly, one result of such retaliation would be a
	substantial reduction of U.S. exports and jobs."
	    The textile legislation, backed strongly by the industry,
	hard hit by imports, and by senators from textile-producing
	states would impose new tough global quotas on textile imports
	and for the first time include Europe in the quotas.
	    Reagan Administration officials have also opposed the
	textile legislation, saying that if it passed it would likely
	prompt a presidential veto.
	    Denman made his comments on the textile issue in a general
	assessment of the Senate trade bill, titled S.490.
	    He said he was concerned about provisions in the Senate
	bill that would limit, if not eliminate, the president's
	discretion if retaliating against nations for keeping their
	home markets closed to foreign goods.
	    U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter has also opposed
	those provisions, arguing that presidential flexibility was
	needed in order to be able to negotiate with countries to open
	their markets, with retaliation being retained as a final, but
	discretionary, weapon.
	    The pending overall trade legislation would force the
	Administration to consult often with Congress and seek its
	approval during step-by-step GATT negotiations.
	    He said "enactment of S. 490 would reduce the confidence of
	other governments in America's commitment to multinational
	trade."

	Britain and West Germany told their
	European Community partners they would strongly oppose major
	elements of proposals to rid the EC of its farm surpluses.
	    At a meeting of EC foreign ministers, Britain called for a
	full debate on a proposed tax on edible oils and fats that has
	already angered EC consumer groups and unleashed Washington-led
	protests from exporters to the EC, diplomats said.
	    West Germany, also opposed to the oils and fats tax, will
	advise the meeting formally later today it cannot countenance
	other proposals that could hit German farmers, they added.
	    They said West Germany's objections were put in a letter
	this weekend from Chancellor Helmut Kohl to Jacques Delors, the
	president of the EC's Executive Commission which had put
	forward the proposals last month in a bid to avoid a new EC
	cash crisis.
	    Kohl reiterated German objections to proposed cereals
	production curbs but reserved his harshest criticism for a
	proposed dismantling of Monetary Compensatory Amounts (MCAs) -
	a system of cross-border subsidies and taxes which level out
	foreign exchange fluctuations for farm exports.
	    Kohl made clear the dismantling would mainly hit German
	farmers who, without MCAs, would find it much more difficult to
	export to weaker currency states, which means virtually all
	other 11 EC states, diplomats said.
	    Britain initiated the discussion on the proposal to impose
	a hefty tax on domestic and imported oils and fats because it
	could seriously damage EC trade relations.
	    The diplomats said the United States had been the most
	outspoken among foreign critics of the proposal, describing it
	as a breach of the EC's obligations under the world trade body
	GATT.
	    But protests had also come from other exporters to the EC,
	such as Senegal, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brazil, Argentina,
	Iceland and Norway, they added.
	    Britain has often lined up against West Germany on the farm
	reform issue in the past but is keen to avoid measures that
	could spark a damaging trade war with the U.S.
	    Foreign ministers were unlikely to take a decision on
	either the oils and fats tax or the MCA proposals today,
	diplomats said. But their discussion should make clear that
	neither has a chance of surviving when it comes up for
	substantive consideration by EC farm ministers later this

	breaks GATT rules, Trade Ministry officials here said.
	    They said Japan submitted a report earlier this month
	alleging South Korea's plan to import less from Japan and more
	from the U.S. And elsewhere was tantamount to creating
	non-tariff trade barriers.
	    South Korea unveiled the plan in November. It said it hoped
	to narrow its trade deficit with Japan to two billion dlrs by

	    South Korea's trade deficit with Japan was a record 5.45
	billion dlrs in 1986, and rose to 752 mln dlrs in the first two
	months of 1987 from 727 mln in the same 1986 period.
	    The plan envisages giving incentives to importers not to
	import Japanese goods, and to exporters to sell more to Japan.
	    The officials said they believed the Japanese action, one
	step short of filing a suit, was designed to bring South Korea
	to the negotiating table and stop the plan.
	    The Seoul government wants Tokyo to ease various import
	restrictions and simplify customs inspections for South Korean

	Several leading farm-state
	Congressmen said they will press the U.S. Agriculture
	Department to implement some kind of marketing loan to make
	soybeans exports competitive while protecting farm income.
	    Speaking at a House grains subcommittee hearing, chairman
	Dan Glickman, D-Kan., proposed that Congressmen and
	representatives of soybean growers meet with USDA on the
	subject in the next two weeks.
	    "Let's see if we can try to push them (USDA) to do
	something without legislation," Glickman told the hearing.
	    The current soybean loan rate effectively is 4.56 dlrs per
	bushel with no income protection, or marketing loan.
	    David Haggard, American Soybean Association, ASA, president
	said USDA must make changes in the soybean program.
	    The current soybean program "gave us the worst of both
	worlds," ASA's Haggard told the hearing. The 1987 loan rate is
	too high relative to corn and is encouraging an expansion of
	soybean production in South America, he said. At the same time,
	the U.S. soybean loan rate is too low to provide any income
	support for soybean farmers, Haggard said.
	    "We need some kind of market loan," he added.
	    The 1985 farm bill provides authority for the Agriculture
	Secretary to implement a marketing loan for soybeans but USDA
	so far has resisted pressure to use the authority.
	    Representatives of ASA met earlier this month with USDA,
	but Haggard said USDA officials gave no indication if they
	would seriously consider offering a marketing loan.
	    USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz yesterday said the
	soybean situation is a "dilemna" which has been studied
	extensively by the department. But he did not say what, if any
	changes, are under consideration.
	    In his testimony, Haggard indicated there are ways other
	than a marketing loan which should be considered to help
	soybean growers, such as a so-called producer option payment,
	or a direct payment program.
	    Haggard said barring any program changes, Commodity Credit
	Corporation, CCC, soybean stocks, now at 385 mln bu, will rise
	to 500 mln by the end of August. A further 100 mln bu of
	soybeans could be forfeited between September and end-year.
	    "Thus, CCC could own the equivalent of Brazil's entire
	soybean crop by the end of calendar year 1987," Haggard said.
	    However, Haggard said that the U.S. should be cautious in
	making soybean program changes that might allow the European
	Community to challenge the U.S. program under the General
	Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT.
	    He noted that The EC imports one quarter of U.S. soybean
	production and loss of that market would be devastating.
	    The Reagan administration has given "mixed signals" on
	whether it believes a marketing loan for soybeans could be
	successfully challenged in GATT by the EC, Haggard said.
	    While the ASA position is to support a 5.02 dlrs per bu
	loan rate combined with a marketing loan, Haggard also endorsed
	a proposal by Rep. Jerry Huckaby, D-La., which would set a six
	dlrs per bu loan rate and apply a marketing loan.
	    The Huckaby proposal is also supported by the ranking
	Republican on the House Agriculture committee, Rep. Edward
	Madigan of Illinois.
	    Subcommittee chairman Glickman endorsed the need to take
	some action on soybeans, but cautioned that the marketing loan
	could mean a substantial increase in budget costs.
	    Glickman noted that the Agriculture Committee must cut one
	to 1.5 billion dlrs from its fiscal 1988 budget and therefore
	must fit any soybean program changes into the overall budget.
	    Haggard said at a soybean loan rate of six dlrs per bu
	combined with a marketing loan, the U.S. soybean price might
	fall to four dlrs per bu initially. This would cost the
	government a maximum of two billion dlrs. But he said the costs
	would decline as market prices recovered.

	The European Community is to offer

	    They said the offer will be made next week in Geneva,

	    Argentine exports of sorghum to Spain fell to zero last
	year from 300,000 tonnes in 1985, while maize sales fell to
	15,000 tonnes from 994,000, official EC statistics show.
	    The sources noted that an agreement between the EC and the
	U.S. guarantees special access to the Spanish market for two
	mln tonnes of non-EC maize and 300,000 tonnes of sorghum each
	year for the next four years.
	    But they said various details of this accord will tend to
	inhibit imports from Argentina.
	    These include a provision for reduction of the amounts if
	Spain imports cereals substitutes, and the EC's plan to import
	the special maize and sorghum on a regular monthly basis.
	Argentina tends to have exportable quantities only three or
	four times a year.

	MCDONNELL <MD> SAID TALKS AT INFORMAL STAGE
TOPICS:
	
PLACES:

CONTENT:
	McDonnell Douglas Corp said recent talks
	with Airbus Industries about joint development and production
	of a new jetliner with the European aircraft manufacturing
	consortium have been very informal.
	    "If there have been talks, they were casual at best," said
	a source at the company. "There is nothing going on that would
	lead to immediate or near-term collaboration" on a new plane.
	    Senior officials at the aerospace firm's St. Louis
	headquarters were unable to comment more specifically on
	weekend published reports from Europe that talks about a joint
	venture have resumed after they broke off last fall.
	    McDonnell Douglas and Airbus last spring and summer had
	discussed jointly developing and building a long-range aircraft
	to compete with Boeing Co <BA> 747 wide-body jetliner, or its
	successor. Talks ended when neither side wanted to forego plans
	to launch its own widebody jetliner projects - McDonnell
	Douglas with its MD-11 and Airbus with its A340.
	    McDonnell Douglas has since launched the MD-11 jetliner, a
	successor to its DC-10, and has more than 100 orders and
	options.
	    Airbus wants to launch its program this spring and is now
	seeking customers for the long-range A340 and a companion
	plane, the shorter-range A330.
	    "I don't want to say we're not interested, because we are
	in any collaboration that benefits McDonnell Douglas without it
	giving up anything," the source told Reuters. "There just
	haven't been in-depth discussions."
	    He said any joint venture would not affect the MD-11
	program already underway.
	    McDonnell Douglas last month claimed Airbus tried to
	overturn pledges made by airlines to buy the MD-11 by offering
	cut-rate prices for the A340.
	    The firm said Airbus, in an effort to line up enough
	customers to launch the program, is engaging in "predatory
	practices" with prices substantially below those needed to
	recover the cost of developing and building the plane.
	    U.S. government and aerospace industry officials believe
	Airbus can offer low prices because the consortium gets
	government subsidies that cover many of its costs.
	    The Reagan Administration decided last month to consult the
	General Agreement on Tariff and Trade, GATT, to determine
	whether Airbus is unfairly subsidized. Under GATT rules an
	enterprise can be subsidized but only if it will make a profit.
	    U.S. officials say Airbus countries have poured 15 billion
	dlrs into Airbus since the early 1970's and the consortium has
	yet to make a profit.

	the Group of Seven leading industrial nations is fully

	    "Let me emphasize that all seven major industrial nations
	remain fully committed to strengthening policy coordination,
	promoting growth and cooperating to foster stability of
	exchange rates," he told the American Enterprise Institute.
	    "We all believe a further decline of the dollar could be

	    Baker also said that after meeting Japanese special envy
	Shintaro Abe, "it's clear that Japan intends to take strong

	U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng
	opens talks with Japanese government officials today well aware
	his demand for the opening of Japanese rice, beef and citrus
	markets is likely to be rejected.
	     But in an interview with Reuters during the flight to
	Tokyo yesterday, Lyng said the goal of his trip was to throw an
	international spotlight on Japan's agricultural import
	protection in the hope pressure would build on Tokyo to open
	its markets.
	    "(The Japanese) have said they are happy we are coming, but
	they are not going to give us anything," Lyng said.
	    U.S. Officials do not expect any Japanese concessions
	during Lyng's two-week visit here. Any farm trade concessions
	would be unveiled later this month, they said.
	    "If there is anything of consequence to offer (Prime
	Minister Yasuhiro) Nakasone would take it with him," when he
	visits Washington later in the month, one U.S. Official said.
	    Lyng plans to ask Japan to open the door to rice imports by
	partially lifting the longstanding ban on foreign purchases.
	    A private U.S. Rice trader visited Tokyo last week
	requesting Japan buy 200,000 tonnes of rice for industrial uses
	such as making sake. Japan has rejected the overture, saying
	Tokyo maintains a policy of self-sufficiency in rice.
	    Lyng will also press Japan to eliminate an import quota for
	beef by April 1988 because he believes Japanese consumers would
	like to buy much more beef than currently allowed.
	    He cited the example of a California company which
	transports live U.S. Cattle to Japan by air for slaughter to
	circumvent the beef quota. The cost of transport is higher than
	the value of the animal, he said.
	    U.S. Officials said the Japan Livestock Industry Promotion
	Corporation which regulates beef imports, was forced to borrow
	from the fiscal 1987 quota earlier this year because the 1986
	quota was exhausted and Japanese beef prices were rising. Japan
	has said it cannot open its markets to beef imports.
	    Along with beef, the U.S. Will also press Japan to
	eliminate import quotas on fresh oranges and orange juice by
	April, 1988. Some U.S. Officials believe Japan may eventually
	be willing to scrap the quota on fresh oranges because
	liberalized trade would not necessarily damage the Japanese
	mandarin orange industry.
	    The quota on juice may be harder to eliminate because
	imports might replace domestic produced juice, U.S. And
	Japanese officials have said.
	   Lyng has resurrected a past U.S. Proposal that Japan buy
	surplus U.S. Foodgrains for donation to developing countries,
	but some U.S. Officials are skeptical action will be taken.
	   Lyng will also urge Japan to put its domestic farm policies,
	including rice, on the negotiating table during GATT talks in
	Geneva. He said Japan must eliminate import quotas on certain
	minor food products or face possible U.S. Reprisals.

CONTENT:
	Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter
	said on Monday that the U.S. free trade agreements with Canada
	and Israel should help to pave the way for liberalizing the
	global trading system.
	    He said the Canadian and Israeli pacts will not set back
	worldwide reform efforts under the General Agreement on Tariffs
	and Trade (GATT) as some critics feared but help them.
	    The GATT talks began a year ago in Punta del Este, Uruguay
	to liberalize the global trading system and to include in it
	trade in agriculture and services such as banking.
	    Yeutter made his remarks at a U.S.-Israeli trade meeting
	marking the second year of their bilateral accord. The
	Canadian-U.S. pact, signed by two sides two weeks ago, has yet
	been approved by the U.S. Congress and Canadian Parliament.
	    The two free trade agreements (FTA) would gradually remove
	tariffs and other barriers to cross-border trade in goods and
	many services.
	    Yeutter said in the aftermath of the Canadian and Israeli
	pacts "other countries have realized that if they want to
	continue to have access to the world's largest market, they had
	better get serious about improving the GATT."
	    The pact with Israel, he said, is gradually increasing
	shipments both ways and the Canadian pact will substantially
	increase the gross national products in both countries.
	    Yeutter also said the Canadian and Israeli pacts should
	serve as important precedents for progress in GATT.
	    Yeutter said, "increasing trade is one of the keys to
	enhanced political and economic stability around the globe."
	    He said, "a stronger GATT will enhance prosperity, not only
	for advanced industrial nations, but also for other countries
	that need to increase trade in order to better their standards
	of living."
	    Yeutter added it was important not to risk the progress
	made in the Israeli and Canadian trade pacts by resorting to
	protectionism.
	    He was referring to trade legislation pending in Congress
	that would force the United States to take retaliatory actions
	against nations with large trade surpluses with the United
	States if the countries practiced unfair trade.
	    The legislation was prompted by a growing U.S. trade
	deficit that hit 156 billion dlrs last year and is still
	rising.
	    Yeutter said the pressures for Congress to act were hard to
	resist, but the pending legislation would undermine President
	Reagan's efforts to liberalize the world trade.
	    Yeutter renewed the threat of a White House veto.
	    He said, "President Reagan will veto any bill that contains
	serious flaws, and I believe that veto would be sustained."

	TRADE ISSUES STRAINING EC'S PATIENCE WITH JAPAN
TOPICS:

CONTENT:
	Member states of the European
	Community are starting to run out of patience with Japan which
	they believe has repeatedly promised major initiatives to open
	its market to imports, but as often made only minor moves.
	    Diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by EC
	countries bear witness to a new disillusionment with the
	willingness, or at least the ability, of the Japanese
	government to reduce its massive trade surplus with the EC.
	    However, they said an all-out trade war may be far off, as
	EC states know they would suffer almost as much as Japan.
	    Senior EC diplomats gave a generally favourable reaction to
	an EC executive commission proposal under which the EC could
	raise tariffs on a range of Japanese products if the U.S.
	Carries out a threat to make a similar move on April 17.
	    The EC tariffs, which would involve renouncing obligations
	entered into with the world trade body GATT, would be designed
	to stop a diversion of exports to the EC market from that of
	the U.S.
	    The diplomats were meeting as Tokyo announced that the EC's
	trade deficit with Japan reached a record 2.13 billion dlrs in
	March, up from 1.94 billion in February.
	    In 1986, Japanese exports to the EC totalled 30.67 billion
	dlrs, up 4.5 pct from 1985, while EC exports to Japan fell one
	pct to 12.43 billion dlrs.
	    In Paris, trade minister Michel Noir said France has
	decided to give Japan a taste of its own medicine.
	    Burgeoning imports of microwave ovens and of frozen
	Coquilles St Jacques will be restricted by a strict application
	of French quality standards -- something EC states say often
	happens to their own exports entering Japan.
	    Britain has threatened to withdraw the licences of Japanese
	banks and insurance companies to operate in the City of London,
	because the British Cable and Wireless company lost out in
	competition for a Japanese telecommucations contract.
	    However, British officials in London have said that the
	government may have gone too far in implying that it would take
	immediate drastic action unless the contract was reopened.
	    By contrast, West Germany, with the EC's most successful
	economy, has never threatened Tokyo with sanctions, preferring
	to rely on firm diplomacy and encouragement of its own
	industries to surmount obstacles to export to Japan.
	    The EC Commission itself has switched its tactics in recent
	years, substituting general calls for action by Japan to open
	its market with specific demands for moves in key areas.
	    At present, it is, for instance, pressuring Japan to end
	allegedly discriminatory taxation of imported wines and
	spirits, to ensure EC companies have a chance to win contracts
	for the building of a new international airport, and to
	simplify certification and safety checks on imported cars.
	    EC officials say these tactics yield some benefits, but
	often the Japanese announce modifications of their non-tariff
	barriers which open the door to imports by only a token amount.
	    They stress, however, that any action must be taken by the
	EC as a whole to stop beggar-my-neighbour action.
	    One of the problems Britain could face if it were to
	withdraw licences for Japanese banks would be that the bankers
	would be welcomed with open arms in Frankfurt or Amsterdam,
	they point out.

	American soybean producers are
	confident the proposed European Community (EC) tax on vegetable

	chance, American Soybean Association (ASA) president-elect
	Wayne Bennett said.
	    Bennett, who is leading one of three soybean producer
	delegations on a lobbying tour of EC capitals, was speaking at
	a lunch.
	    After meetings at the Economics and Foreign ministries this
	morning, he said the Dutch Government had indicated it would
	vote against the proposal, as had a number of other countries.
	    "Our information suggests we will have the required number
	of votes in Brussels to prevent the tax proposal going forward,"
	he said.
	    "The proposal has been talked of in Brussels for the past 20
	years, and dropped every time. What we want now is to kill it
	once and for all," Bennett added.
	    Backing up the soybean producers' active lobbying, the U.S.
	Government has also indicated it will be prepared to retaliate
	with penal import taxes if the proposal does get through, he
	said.
	    The U.S. Government also feels it has a good case to fight
	the proposed tax in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
	(GATT), a U.S. Embassy spokesman said.
	    U.S. Exports of soybeans and products to the EC account for
	one-fifth of annual production, and are worth about 2.5 billion
	dlrs a year, Bennett said.
	    The proposed tax on oils and fats would hit U.S. Producers
	badly while at the same time virtually doubling the price of
	soyoil in the EC, which would suffer far worse than other
	higher-priced oils because of the nature of the proposed tax,
	he added.
	    The revenue to the EC from the tax would simply be used to
	finance the EC's own oilseed subsidy machine, he said.
	    "We in the ASA are dedicated free-traders. We helped defeat
	the Wine Equity Act two years ago, but we will not stand by and
	watch our own farmers suffer from such protectionist EC
	measures," Bennett said.
	    "The mood in the U.S. Is turning increasingly protectionist,
	and the EC's actions are fueling the chances of a trade war,"

	A senior British official said that
	protectionist bills being considered by Congress could trigger
	retaliation by the European Community (EEC) and threaten the

	    Paul Channon, secretary for trade and industry, said if
	Congress passed legislation to curb textile imports, which
	would hit EC shipments as well as shipments from major Asian
	textile producers, "the community would have to retaliate."
	    His comments echoed those made yesterday by Belgian Trade
	Minister Herman De Croo, who said if the bill passed, the
	community would retaliate by imposing taxes on U.S. exports.
	    Channon made his remarks at a news conference after two
	days of talks with Reagan Administration officials and members
	of Congress.
	    De Croo was also in Washington for trade talks.
	    Channon said there was a greater protectionism sentiment in
	Congress since his visit here last year as Congress and the
	Administration tried to find ways to reduce the U.S. trade
	deficit, which last year hit a record 169.8 billion dlrs.
	    Channon also called for greater EC-U.S. cooperation to
	force Japan to open its markets to foreign goods.
	    Channon said Japan's trade surplus is causing everyone
	problems - its surplus with the United States last year was
	51.5 billion dlrs and with EC nations, 16.7 billion dlrs.
	    "The more united pressure there could be, the better," he
	said.
	    Channon also called for increased U.S.-EC cooperation to
	avoid trade disputes.
	    He said the two sides narrowly avoided a confrontation
	earlier this year over lost grains sales when Spain and
	Portugal joined the community and its liberal imports
	regulations were tightened to conform to EC standards.
	    "But if both sides drew back from the brink that time," he
	said, ""it does not mean that they would do so on another
	occasion."
	    Channon added that "There is increasing reesentment in
	Europe over the U.S. tactic of negotiating under the pressure
	of unilaterally imposed deadlines."
	    He said other potential conflicts are already in sight -
	alleged European government subsidies of Airbus aircraft and
	taxes on fats and oils - and "the commuity and the United States
	must therefore learn to manage their relations better."
	    He said another bill to let the United States retaliate
	against a nation if that nation's market was not open to U.S.
	goods would bypass the trade pact GATT (General Agreeeement on
	Tariffs and Trade) as an arbiter of trade practices.
	    He said foreign trade law should be judged by GATT and not
	by the United States, adding "if the (trade) law is to be
	interpreted by the United States and not by the GATT, what is
	to happen to the rest of us?"

	Dismantling agricultural subsidies
	and implementing international farm policy reform will be the
	top priorities of the United States at the upcoming Venice
	Economic Summit, Secretary of State George Shultz told a group
	of American farm leaders.
	    "We want to see the American farmer put in a position in
	which he can compete on a level playing field," Shultz told the
	board of directors for the National Association of Wheat
	Growers.
	    The global agricultural situation is in the midst of the
	most serious farm crisis in modern history, Shultz said, and
	how the U.S. responds to the current problems will determine
	whether the U.S. will continue its leadership role in world
	agriculture.
	    Government policies that subsidize production and exports
	have created a "crisis of overproduction," he said. Shultz
	particularly criticized European Community policies which he
	said encourage domestic production by providing high government
	supports to farmers and then exporting the surplus product with
	the help of huge subsidies.
	    The U.S. and its trading partners cannot afford to continue
	current high levels of subsidies, he said. But the U.S. cannot
	stop subsidies alone, Shultz said. "We have to agree to
	dismantle these systems together," he said.
	    The U.S., EC and Japan have the obligation to take the lead
	in agricultural reform, he said. For that reason, U.S.
	officials will push for farm reform at the Venice meeting and
	have made it a top priority for GATT negotiations in Geneva.

	Australia accused the U.S. of increasing
	protectionism on agricultural products and called for an end to
	Washington's special 32-year exemption from certain GATT rules
	on agricultural trade.
	    Robert Arnott, Australia's delegate to the General
	Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), made the appeal at a
	special annual meeting which reviews the 1955 U.S. waiver.
	    "Australia today said the United States' goals of reducing
	U.S. barriers to agricultural trade were being contradicted by
	actions which in fact increased protection in trade in
	agriculture," the Australian delegation said in a statement.
	    "The United States section 22 waiver is one of the basic
	flaws in the GATT coverage of agriculture," Arnott told the
	meeting.
	    Arnott said the waiver had continually been used as a
	justification for "dubious protective measures" by the U.S. He
	listed a recent Dairy Export Incentive Program and steps to
	close the U.S. sugar market to imports.
	    He also told Reuters the waiver allowed Washington to
	impose quotas on imports of farm products where it had domestic
	support programs. This covered imports of dairy products,
	peanuts, cotton and sugar.
	    Asked to comment, Michael Samuels, U.S. ambassador to the

	EC COMMISSION DEFENDS OILS AND FATS TAX
TOPICS:

PLACES:

CONTENT:
	A spokesman for the European
	Community Commission defended the controversial plan for a levy
	on oils and fats, saying that consumers would have to help
	alleviate the surplus problem by paying the proposed tax.
	    Norbert Tanghe, head of division of the Commission's
	Directorate General for Agriculture, told the 8th Antwerp Oils
	and Fats Contact Days "the Commission firmly believes that the
	sacrifices which would be undergone by Community producers in
	the oils and fats sector ... Would justify asking consumers to
	make an appropriate contribution to solving the serious problem
	within that sector by paying a levy."
	    The proposed tax is necessary because the level of
	budgetary costs resulting from olive oil and oilseeds
	production has become unacceptable, Tanghe said.
	    Recent estimates put these costs at 4.0 billion European
	Currency Units and by 1990 they would rise by another 2.0
	billion Ecus, he said. In 1990 the Community's "standstill"
	agreements with Spain and Portugal end and the EC would then
	feel the full impact of its enlargement.
	    The Commission has proposed several cost and production
	cutting measures which include the introduction of a maximum
	guaranteed quantity system, he added.
	    Under the Commission's system for stabilising consumer
	prices in the oils and fats sector, a reference price of 700
	Ecus per tonne for refined soy oil would be introduced, Tanghe
	said.
	    Consumer prices could be raised or lowered by a regulatory
	amount when market prices are below or above this level.
	    He said the revenue generated by charging a regulatory
	amount would be used to finance the Common Agricultural
	Policy's oils and fats regime.
	    "The Commission believes that hostile reactions (to the
	proposed tax) have for the most part been based on incomplete
	or an insufficiently thorough analysis of the proposal," he said.
	    Tanghe said the proposed system conforms with General
	Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT, rules.
	    It would not be discriminatory because it would be applied
	to domestic and imported products, and past experience showed
	it would not cause any decline in consumption of oils and fats.
	    EC-produced oilseeds would not benefit more than they do
	under present aid arrangements, he said.
	    The competitiveness between different oils, whether EC
	produced or imported, would remain unchanged and quantities
	imported from third countries would not be affected by the tax,
	Tanghe said.
	    The proposed system would not alter the EC nations'
	requirements as far as imports are concerned since the overall
	effect would stabilise Community production levels without
	affecting demand, he said.
	    It is one of the proposal's objectives to maintain current
	import levels, he said.
	    Imports of soybeans would be unaffected because they are
	imported primarily to satisfy the EC's cakes and meals
	requirements, which are not covered by the stabilising system.
	Furthermore, more than half the oil produced from imported
	beans is re-exported to third countries, Tanghe added.

	trade disputes should be dealt with through negotiations,

	    "It is dangerous to establish a rule that trading partners

	purely the result of unfair trade practices by foreign nations.

	Japan and the U.S. Kick off top-level
	trade talks tomorrow amid signs officials from both sides are
	growing increasingly irritated with each other.
	    The talks, held annually at sub-cabinet level to review the
	whole gamut of U.S./Japan economic relations, will pave the way
	for American Secretary of State George Schultz's one day
	stop-over here at end-week on his way home from China.
	    Faced with growing Congressional protectionist pressure,
	the U.S. Administration is pressing Japan for speedy action to
	reduce its still huge trade surplus, U.S. Officials said.
	    "We appreciate their frustration," a senior Japanese
	government official said. "But we are also frustrated."
	    The official said the 40 pct rise of the yen over the last
	18 months has hit Japan hard, forcing exporters to slash
	spending and lay off workers to make up for lost sales abroad.
	That has not yet shown up in dollar-based statistics on trade,
	but it will, he said.
	    He said the U.S. Administration was ignoring the progress
	that has been made and instead emphasizing the problems that
	remain when it talks with Congress.
	    "It would only take five minutes to list their
	accomplishments," a senior U.S. Official replied.
	    The talks begin tomorrow with high-level discussions on the
	economic structures of both countries and how they affect the
	bilateral trade imbalance, which last year amounted to 51.48
	billion dlrs in Japan's favour.
	    On the following two days, the topics will range from
	multilateral trade talks under the auspices of the General
	Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to such bilateral trade
	problems as super computers.
	    The structural talks are intended to be free-wheeling
	discussions among senior officials. Tomorrow's topics include
	savings and investment issues such as consumer credit and
	housing, and the implications of government budget deficits.
	    These talks come at a particularly delicate time for the
	Japanese government, which is facing increasing domestic
	pressure to abandon its tight-fisted fiscal policy and
	stimulate the sagging economy by spending more.
	    Some U.S. Officials complained Japan has no intention of
	boosting domestic demand and imports, as Washington wants.
	    Japanese officials in turn pointed the finger at the huge
	U.S. Budget deficit as one of the main culprits for the trade
	imbalance. That budget deficit has meant that the U.S. Is
	buying more imports.
	    Japan seems particularly peeved at being singled in a draft
	trade bill before the Senate as a nation following adverserial
	trade practices. "It condemns Japan without due process," one
	Japanese official said.
	    That reference spoils what is otherwise a well-thought-out
	bill introduced by Democratic Senator Lloyd Bentsen, he said.
	    Japan is also not totally happy with the administration's
	trade bill, particularly its proposal to establish reciprocal
	access to foreign markets as one criteria for retaliatory trade
	action by the U.S., Officials said.
	    Nevertheless, Japanese officials said they remain in a weak
	bargaining position, especially with the threat of a trade bill
	overhanging them.
	    "We have no leverage," one official admitted.
	    As a result, Tokyo is striving to meet U.S. Complaints
	about its trade practices in a variety of fields, including
	super computers.
	    The U.S. Is pressing for greater access to the Japanese
	super computer market.
	    The Japanese government has sent a long questionnaire to
	public institutions like universities which buy the
	sophisticated machines in hopes of eventually setting up
	informal bidding procedures easily understood by all potential
	sellers, officials said.

	November, and updated a previous EC list.
	    EC External Trade Relations Commissioner Willy De Clercq
	said its object was to show such actions were not solely taken
	by trading partners of the U.S. And that "the U.S. Were not
	innocents in the matter."
	    The report covers the entire field of EC-U.S. Commercial
	relations and lists more than 30 obstacles ranging from tariff
	measures, import quotas, customs duties, anti-dumping
	procedures, fiscal barriers and export subsidies.
	    The Commission said not all the barriers mentioned were
	necessarily inconsistent with U.S. International obligations,
	and emphasised many of them could be removed at upcoming
	international trade talks. "The purpose of the report is to make
	clear that trade practices which impede exports are not a
	unique problem only faced by U.S. Exporters. Europeans face
	similar problems in the U.S.," it said.
	    Among the obstacles detailed in the report are import
	restrictions on food products, such as cheese, sugar and syrup,
	certain wines, beers and juices, as well as on firearms and
	machine tools.
	    It also criticises programs to boost U.S. Cereals exports.
	The document said the U.S.'s three-year export enhancement
	program (EEP), which began in 1985, had subsidised exports of
	9.7 mln tonnes of wheat, two mln tonnes of wheat flour and 2.8
	mln tonnes of barley up to mid-March this year. The subsidies
	granted so far were worth about 620 mln dlrs, it added.
	    "The Community has already reacted where necessary to U.S.
	EEP subsidies by increasing its exports refunds, and will
	continue to do so," it said, adding the current GATT round would
	also provide an opportunity to address the subject.
	    The document also says import quotas maintained by the U.S.
	On a range of farm products, including sugar, peanuts and
	certain cottons, restrict EC exports.
	    In addition, the report deplores a recent U.S.-Japan accord
	on semi-conductors, export controls on technology transfers,
	standards tests in the telecommunications arena and the U.S.
	Administration's "buy American" public procurement policy.

	YEUTTER SEES GATT CONSENSUS ON FARM TRADE REFORM
TOPICS:

CONTENT:
	U.S. Trade Representative
	Clayton Yeutter said trade ministers meeting here have reached
	a general consensus on agricultural trade reform under the
	latest Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
	Trade (GATT).
	    Yeutter gave no precise details of the understanding but
	told journalists the consensus covers the principles involved
	in agricultural trade reform and what needs to be done to
	improve the global situation in agriculture.
	    Delegates from 22 countries are meeting informally to
	discuss progress made since the latest GATT round was launched
	in Punta del Este, Uruguay, last September.
	    Yeutter said "at least people seem to be going down the same
	road...But how that translates ultimately into negotiations is
	another matter entirely."
	    There seems to be an understanding of the need to deal with
	the problem quickly and "a more common understanding of how we
	are going to get from here to there," Yeutter said.
	    However, the hard work is still to come, with a couple of
	years of tough negotiations ahead, he said.
	    "It is ludicrous for the nations of the world to plough
	immense amounts of financial resources into the production of
	items that nobody wants to buy," he said.
	    He said the long-term answer is to switch some of the
	financial resources now committed to agriculture to other more
	productive areas. This would help agriculture because some its
	inefficient non-productive segments would stop operating, he
	said.
	    Individual segments in many countries may lose in the
	process, but it should result in a more rational system of
	world-wide production within 10 or 15 years, he said.
	    It is important that the agriculture negotiations reach a
	relatively early conclusion because the U.S. Is spending 26
	billion dlrs a year and the European Community probably more
	than that, which is an ineffective use of financial resources,
	he said.
	    Asked about the prospect of a priority for agriculture in
	the negotiations, he said "one has to be politically
	realistic... If there is any chance of getting it (agricultural
	trade reform) done in two to three years it's going to have to
	be as part of a larger package."

	ACP STATES SAY EC OILS TAX PLAN BREAKS ACCORDS

	Developing countries said the European
	Community (EC) would breach two international agreements if it
	went ahead with its plans for an oils and fats tax.
	    Ambassadors to the EC from African, Caribbean and Pacific
	(ACP) states told a press conference the tax would hit the
	exports of 26 ACP countries.
	    They said the EC failed to follow consultation procedures
	laid down in the Lome Convention which regulates relations
	between ACP states and the bloc for moves which could affect
	trade between the two sides.
	    They also said the EC would be in breach of an undertaking
	not to bring in new protectionist measures during the current
	Punta del Este round of world trade negotiations being held
	under GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) auspices.
	    The EC Commission has proposed a tax of up to 330 European
	currency units (Ecus) a tonne on both imported and EC-produced
	vegetable and marine fats for human consumption, which could
	raise up to two billion Ecus a year.
	    EC farm ministers, who would have to approve such a tax,
	are split on the issue and are expected to decide it at a
	marathon meeting on EC farm prices beginning in Luxembourg on
	June 15.
	    Jamaican ambassador Leslie Wilson said ACP countries are
	convinced this would lead to EC industry substituting products
	made within the bloc for oil and fat imports. The ACP estimates
	this would result in a fall of 160 to 185 mln Ecus in its
	member country exports.
	    "We can't believe the EC would willingly take measures to
	undermine our countries, but such would be the impact of these
	measures," Wilson said.
	    The U.S. and Malaysia say their exports would also be hit
	by the proposed tax and they may take retaliatory action if it
	is approved.
	    Wilson said the ACP would take such steps only "as a very
	last resort," but added that the ACP is in touch with other
	countries which oppose the plan.
	    Wilson, who was chairing the news conference, made it clear
	Jamaica itself would not be hit by the tax as it does not
	export oils and fats.
	    Among the worst hit countries would be Ivory Coast,
	Senegal, Nigeria and Papua New Guinea, the ACP says.

	U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard
	Lyng said he is pleased the European Community plans to offer a
	global farm reform plan at GATT later this month, although the
	United States opposes key parts of the proposal.
	    "We're pleased that they have moved in tabling a proposal.
	It will help us in getting the negotiations underway," Lyng
	told Reuters in an interview Tuesday.
	    Lyng's comment came after EC ministers in Luxembourg
	endorsed a farm reform package drafted by the EC Commission.
	The EC plan will be presented at the next meeting of Uruguay
	round agriculture negotiators in Geneva on October 26.
	    Lyng said the United States would oppose parts of the plan
	seeking a market sharing agreement for grains, and proposing
	curbs on U.S. soybean and cereal substitute exports to Europe.
	    The U.S. in July proposed to GATT the elimination of all
	farm subsidies affecting trade within ten years, and has
	pressed the EC to make a counter-offer with the aim of reaching
	a global farm subsidy agreement by the end of 1988.
	    However, the EC and some U.S. domestic groups have said the
	Reagan administration plan to end all farm trade subsidies is
	unrealistic.
	    Asked about such criticism, Lyng said "The alternative to
	doing that is to say that we preserve them and maintain them. I
	think that is the unrealistic position."
	    "I would suggest that they (EC) listen to what we are
	trying to say."
	    Lyng also rejected suggestions the U.S. and EC agree a
	freeze in export subsidies to get the GATT negotiations 
	started.
	    "All that some countries would like to have would be a
	wheat agreement where we would stop export subsidies on wheat.
	That doesn't do a thing for us," Lyng said.
	    The United States wants an end to subsidies in a range of
	agricultural products from dairy products to vegetable oils, he
	said.
	    At the GATT negotiators meeting next week Canada is

	    "They (GATT talks) really have to deal with domestic
	policies, as well as trade arrangements," Wallis said.
	    Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter has said a summit
	statement of support for agriculture talks is part of an
	overall U.S. strategy to build momentum for the GATT farm
	talks.
	    Public statements in recent weeks by several members of the
	Reagan cabinet have stressed the agriculture issue.
	    Yeutter and Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng will
	repeatedly discuss agriculture during a visit to Japan starting
	next week. Yeutter said agriculture will also be on the agenda
	of the trade ministers "quadrilateral" talks among
	Japan, the European Community, the U.S. and Canada this month.
	    And the ministerial meeting of the Paris-based Organization
	for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, in May will
	highlight the agriculture problem, Yeutter said.
	    The OECD in May is expected to release a study of domestic
	farm subsidies which shows that Japan has the highest subsidies
	among industrial countries, but aid to farmers is also generous
	in the EC and United States.
	    The controversial OECD study calculated a measure of farm
	subsidies called the Producer Subsidy Equivalent, PSE, which
	allows farm aid to be compared across countries.
	    Some officials including British Agriculture Minister
	Michael Jopling, have said the PSE could be useful as a method
	of negotiating lower domestic farm subsidies worldwide.
	    However, the State Department's Wallis said while the PSE
	can be useful in negotiations, it has shortcomings and "its not
	definitive."
	    He and other U.S. officials said the Reagan administration
	has not yet reached a decision on a specific U.S. agriculture
	proposal to present to the GATT.
	    "I would expect it (U.S. proposal) to be in the fall,"
	after the series of international meetings, Wallis said.
	    At preliminary meetings of the GATT agriculture committee,
	the United States has pushed for the so-called "freeze and
	rollback" approach. Subsidies would first be frozen at current
	levels, then rolled-back jointly in stages.
	    However, the Reagan administration perplexed some trade
	analysts recently by reacting cooly to a plan by Australian
	prime minister Bob Hawke calling for a similar approach. Hawke
	unveiled a seven-point plan to freeze and subsequently reduce
	the gap between high farm price supports and world prices.
	    Australia is leading a the so-called Cairns group of 13
	coutries pressing for freer agriculture trade.
	    "The proposals that the so-called Cairns group are coming
	up with seem to be focusing on short-run, quick fixes which is
	not what we think is what's called for here," Wallis said.
	    Wallis and other said the U.S. wants a "long-range"
	solution to the agriculture problem.
	    U.S. officials also have criticized the Australian proposal
	because they said it deals primarily with the difference
	between domestic prices and world levels in the EC and U.S.,
	but fails to focus on the question of market access.
	    At the same time the U.S. is rejecting the Australian
	"quick fix", Wallis said the U.S. will press at the summit for
	a declaration urging that agriculture talks be completed
	"expeditiously", or within two years.
	    The unstated U.S. strategy, U.S. officials said, is to keep
	the pressure on the EC this year through the export enhancement
	program and lower value of the dollar, in the hope that a
	sweeping agriculture agreement is possible in 1988.

	NAKASONE SOUNDS CONCILIATORY NOTE IN CHIP DISPUTE

	Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone sounded
	a conciliatory note in Japan's increasingly bitter row with the
	United States over trade in computer microchips.
	    "Japan wants to resolve the issue through consultations by
	explaining its stance thoroughly and correcting the points that
	need to be corrected," he was quoted by Kyodo News Service as
	saying.
	    While expressing regret over America's decision to impose
	tariffs on imports of Japanese electrical goods, Nakasone said
	Tokyo was willing to send a high-level official to Washington
	to help settle the dispute.
	    Government officials said Japan would make a formal request
	next week for emergency talks and that the two sides would
	probably meet the week after, just days before the April 17
	deadline set by Washington for the tariffs to take effect.
	    Tokyo is expected to propose a joint U.S./Japan
	investigation of American claims that Japanese companies are
	dumping cut-price chips in Asian markets.
	    Yesterday, Washington announced plans to put as much as 300
	mln dlrs in tariffs on imports of certain Japanese electronic
	goods in retaliation for what it sees as Tokyo's failure to
	live up to their bilateral chip pact.
	    That agreement, hammered out late last year after months of
	heated negotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price
	chips in world markets and to buy more American-made chips.
	    Nakasone's comments seemed distinctly more conciliatory
	than those of his Trade and Industry Minister, Hajime Tamura,
	who earlier today said Japan was ready to take "appropriate
	measures" if Washington went ahead with the sanctions.
	    Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)
	officials later sought to downplay the significance of Tamura's
	remark and said that his main message was that the two sides
	need to talk urgently about the issue.
	    But they admitted that Japan was considering taking the
	United States to GATT, the Geneva-based international
	organization which polices world trade, if Washington imposed
	the tariffs.
	    Any Japanese action would probably be taken under Article
	23 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), they
	said. If that article were invoked, GATT would set up a panel
	to consider the legality of the U.S. Action.
	    But officials here said they hope that can be avoided. "It
	may be wishful thinking but there is a possibility the United
	States may lift its decision at an early date," Tamura said.
	    In announcing the U.S. Sanctions yesterday, President
	Ronald Reagan said he was prepared to lift them once he had
	evidence that Japan was no longer dumping chips in world
	markets and had opened up its own market to imports.
	    Japanese government officials said they are confident they
	can make the pact work.
	    They said that the export of cut-price Japanese chips
	through unregulated distributors has all but dried up after
	MITI instructed domestic makers to cut output.
	    While acknowledging that it is harder to increase Japanese
	imports of American chips, MITI officials said that the
	ministry is doing all it can to ensure that happens.
	    The Ministry recently called on Japan's major chip users,
	some of whom are also leading producers, to step up their
	purchases of foreign semiconductors.
	    A spokesman for one of the companies, Toshiba Corp <TSBA.T>
	said his firm would do just that and could announce its plans
	in the next week or so. He expects other Japanese companies to
	do likewise.

	Yeutter suggested the U.S. could file a formal complaint with

	Canada's decision to impose duties on U.S. corn imports.

	said the U.S. could file a formal complaint with GATT under the
	dispute settlement procedures of the subsidies code.
	    Other U.S. options would be to appeal the decision in
	Canadian courts, or to retaliate against Canadian goods, a
	lower-level U.S. trade official said. However, retaliation is
	an unlikely step, at least initially, that official said. No

	Ministers from more than 20
	nations were told by New Zealand that the next international
	negotiations on liberalising trade would be the last this
	century and the cost of failure could not be measured.
	    Trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues at a
	welcoming ceremony before two days of talks here that great
	progress had been made in preparing for the negotiations which
	must not be sidetracked.
	    "We live in troubled and dangerous times for the world
	trading system," he said.
	    "We have seen that the failure of the world trading system
	has caused great depression and conflict in the past. Our
	failure to maintain the momentum will be at great cost to us
	all," Moore said.
	    He added: "The cost of failure is beyond calculation. It is
	our last hope and best opportunity this century. We will not
	get another chance before the year 2000."
	    The ministers are in New Zealand to review world trade
	since the "Uruguay round" talks last Sepember. The meeting is
	also part of preparations for a full-scale conference of the
	General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Venice in
	June.
	    The Uruguay meeting is considered by most countries to have
	been particularly successful, with northern hemisphere
	countries managing to have service industries such as banking
	and insurance included in the next full round.
	    The southerners' goal of including agricultural and
	tropical products also was met.
	    The meeting at this North Island tourist resort is
	described by participants as informal and no declaration is
	expected.
	    Moore said one aim was to "instil a sense of political
	urgency to avert potential economic tragedy."
	    Another was to seek ways of popularising freer trade to
	people who felt the pain of readjustment but could not see the
	benefits, as well as preventing "bush fires of confrontation
	while we proceed with orderly negotiations."
	    The meeting is being attended by 25 overseas delegations
	including representatives of GATT and the Economic Community.
	    The delegates include U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
	Yeutter.
	    American sources say he is ready to state that the best way
	to reverse protectionist sentiment in the United States is to
	implement four key Uruguay proposals:
	    -- an end to agricultural subsidies;
	    -- inclusion of trade in services and investments in GATT
	regulations;
	    -- tightening of restrictions on pirating of so-called
	intellectual property such as trademarks, patents and
	copyrights;
	    -- new rules to resolve trade disputes among GATT's 92
	member states.
	    Earlier, New Zealand sources had said French Foreign Trade
	Minister Michel Noir had pulled out of the informal GATT talks
	for domestic political reasons.
	    Cabinet chief Bernard Prauge will lead the French
	delegation.

	William Bywater, president of the
	International Union of Electronic Workers, called on President
	Reagan to retaliate against Japan for unfair practices in
	semiconductor trade.
	    He said in a statement a crash program was needed in the
	semiconductor industry to prevent the United States from
	becoming "one of the world's industrial lightweights."
	    Bywater's remarks came as the White House Economic Policy
	Council prepared for a Thursday meeting to decide what
	sanctions if any should be taken against Japan for alleged 
	violations of a U.S.-Japanese semiconductors agreement.
	    The pact, agreed to last July, called for Tokyo to end
	selling semiconductors at below cost and to open its home
	market to U.S. goods. In return, Washington agreed to forego
	antidumping duties on Japanese semiconductors.
	    But U.S. officials have said that while Japan has stopped
	dumping in the U.S. market, it has not ended third country
	dumping; nor has it opened its market to U.S. semiconductors.
	    Japan yesterday, in an effort to ward off U.S. action,
	ordered a cutback in semiconductors production as a way to
	force prices up and end the dumping.
	    Bywater, in his statement, said he backed a Defense Science
	Board task force proposal to set up a consortium to develop new
	electronic products and manufacturing processes and make the
	U.S. industory more competitive.
	    But he added the industry could not wait for legislation to
	pass and that action was required now to help the depressed
	electronic industry.
	    Bywater said, "I urge the Reagan Administration to take full
	and severe action immediately against Japan by invoking the
	retaliatory steps that are permitted under U.S. law and GATT
	(General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade)."

	The European Community (EC) accused the
	United States of violating a political commitment to free trade
	through practices including a tax on imported gasoline and a
	customs user fee.
	    EC ambassador Tran Van-Thinh made the formal charge to the
	surveillance body of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
	(GATT), GATT spokesman David Woods told reporters.
	    Woods also said the EC was joined by the United States in
	criticising Brazil for extending its list of products for which
	import licenses have been temporarily suspended, so as to
	improve its balance of payments.
	    The United States charged Japan with violating GATT rules
	by restricting imports of agricultural products through an
	import licensing system. The United States asked for
	consultations with Tokyo on the issue.
	    Tran charged that the trade measures contravened a
	political commitment to halt and reverse trade barriers,
	pledged by ministers in Punta del Este last September.
	    When ministers established the four year Uruguay round to
	negotiate freer trade in 13 areas, they set up the GATT
	surveillance body to monitor this commitment, known in GATT
	jargon as "standstill and rollback."
	    Tran criticised Washington for the "superfund" tax on oil
	imports, a customs user fee, and the removal of a special
	machine tool (known as category FSC34) from its government
	procurement list for reasons of national security.
	    Warren Lavorel, a U.S. Trade official, defended the
	policies, saying they did not violate GATT trade rules.
	    The surveillance body will send a record of today's talks
	to the Trade Negotiating Committee, which oversees the round,
	to decide any further action on the charges.
	    The oil tax and customs user fee have already been the
	subject of formal GATT dispute panels set up outside the
	Uruguay Round to rule on the legality of the practices.
	    The ruling GATT Council yesterday adopted a dispute panel's
	report and ruled that the U.S. Superfund tax on oil imports
	breached trade rules. It called on Washington to modify its
	legislation.
	    Mexico and Canada, along with the European Community,

	    Kato said Japan will maintain its current level of

	    "That is really a strong rationale why we need a new GATT

	REAGAN TO ANNOUNCE DECISION ON JAPAN SANCTIONS
TOPICS:

PLACES:
	usa, japan
CONTENT:
	President Reagan today is to
	announce a decision on tough new tariffs on Japanese exports to
	retaliate for what he calls Japan's failure to end its unfair
	practices in semiconductor trade.
	    The 100 pct tariffs are to be imposed on 300 mln dlrs of
	Japanese goods recommended for curbs by a special panel of
	experts headed by the U.S. Trade Representative's Office.
	    Reagan announced last March 27 he would impose the tariffs
	on certain goods taken from a list that ranged from computors
	and television sets to power tools and photographic film.
	    The panel this week winnowed through the list of the some
	20 products and sent their recommendations yesterday to Santa
	Barbara, where Reagan is vacationing.
	    In his March annoucement, Reagan said "I am committed to
	full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide
	American industry with free and fair trade opportunities."
	    He added the tariffs would be lifted once Japan honored the
	pact it signed last year to end dumping semiconductors in world
	markets and opened its home market to U.S. products.
	    U.S. officials said Japan had done nothing since the March
	announcement to alter Reagan's plan to invoke the sanctions.
	    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said yesterday:  "we
	do not want a trade war, but we feel that this is the kind of
	action that requires meaningful action."
	    Reagan's move follows steadily rising U.S. trade deicits,
	with last year's hitting a record $169.8 billion.
	    About one-third of the deficit is in trade with Japan.
	    Congress is weighing a trade bill to force the president to
	retaliate in certain cases of unfair trade practices.
	    He has opposed the legislation, saying it would prevent
	negotiated solutions to trade disputes and, in any case, that
	existing law was adqeuate to end unfair trade practices.
	    Trade experts say his tough action against the Japanese was
	as much to penalize the Japanese as to show Congress he did not
	need any new trade legislation.
	    The Japanese have complained that they have been honoring
	the semiconductor pact, but that it would take time before the
	results showed up.
	    U.S. officials, however, have said their monitoring of
	Japanese semiconductor shipments to East Asian countries and
	Western Europe showed no letup in the dumping and that the
	Japanese home markets remained shut to American exports.
	    Japan has said that if Reagan imposed the tariffs, it would
	file a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade
	(GATT).
	    It said hoped GATT would find the U.S. retaliation had
	violated the regulations of the global trading group and would
	approve compensation or Japanese retaliation.
	    U.S. officials have said they did not think Japan would
	retaliate because it had too much to lose in any trade war with
	the United States.

	CHINA CALLS FOR BETTER TRADE DEAL WITH U.S.

	China called on the United States to
	remove curbs on its exports, to give it favourable trading
	status and ease restrictions on exports of high technology.
	    But the U.S. Embassy replied that Chinese figures showing
	13 years of trade deficits with the U.S. Out of the last 15 are
	inaccurate and said Peking itself would have to persuade
	Congress to change laws which limit its exports.
	     The official International Business newspaper today
	published China's demands in a  editorial to coincide with the
	visit of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz.
	     "It is extremely important that the U.S. Market reduce its
	restrictions on Chinese imports, provide the needed facilities
	for them and businessmen from both sides help to expand Chinese
	exports," the editorial said.
	     "The U.S. Should quickly discard its prejudice against
	favourable tariff treatment for Chinese goods and admit China
	into the Generalised System of Preference (GSP).
	     "Despite easing of curbs on U.S. Technology exports in
	recent years, control of them is still extremely strict and
	influences normal trade between the two countries," it added
	     The paper also printed an article by China's commercial
	counsellor in its Washington embassy, Chen Shibiao, who said
	that "all kinds of difficulties and restrictions" were preventing
	bilateral trade fulfilling its full potential.
	     He named them as U.S. Protectionist behaviour, curbs on
	technology transfer and out-of-date trade legislation.
	     The paper also printed a table showing that, since
	bilateral trade began in 1972, China has had a deficit every
	year except 1972 and 1977. It shows the 1986 and 1985 deficits
	at 2.09 billion and 1.722 billion dlrs.
	     A U.S. Embassy official said the U.S. Did not accept
	Peking's trade figures at all, mainly because they exclude
	goods shipped to Hong Kong and then trans-shipped to U.S. While
	U.S. Figures are based on country of origin.
	     He said that, if China wants to obtain GSP status, it will
	have to lobby Congress itself to persaude it to amend several
	laws which currently prevent Peking getting such status.
	     The U.S. Trade Act of 1974 says that to qualify for GSP,
	China must be a member of the General Agreement of Tariffs and
	Trade (GATT), for which it applied in July 1986, and "not be
	dominated or controlled by international Communism."
	     The official said China was well aware of the laws, some
	of which date to the anti-Communist early 1950's, but that
	there is not sufficient political will in the U.S. To change
	them.
	     China has been the subject of about a dozen cases
	involving anti-dumping in the U.S. Within the last two years,
	which the U.S. Side won, he said.
	     But, for the first time, China signed last week an
	agreement which it itself initiated to voluntarily restrain
	exports of at least two categories of steel goods, which may
	lead the U.S. Side to withdraw the anti-dumping case, he added.
	     Another diplomat said willingness to provide such
	voluntary export restraints would be an important issue in
	bilateral trade issues and in Peking's application to GATT.
	     "China has the potential to disrupt world markets,
	especially in textiles. Other GATT countries will be nervous
	about China in this respect. But there is a precedent for other
	centralled planned economies in GATT," the diplomat said.
	     Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Romania are members of
	GATT but none has China's massive market potential for imports
	or its vast labour pool to produce cheap exports.
	     In a speech today in the northeast city of Dalian, U.S.
	Secretary of State George Shultz said his country welcomed
	China's interest in participating in GATT.
	     "The process of Chinese accession will not be accomplished
	overnight -- the GATT rules were not designed for a large
	economy of the Chinese type," Shultz said.
	     "China can play an important role by actively joining GATT
	discussions seeking to expand general trading opportunities and
	enhance market access for exports worldwide. China can further
	develop its foreign trade system so as to gain the maximum
	benefit from its GATT participation," he said.
	     The problems facing U.S.-China trade and GATT membership
	are similar -- a pricing system which many foreign businessmen
	regard as arbitrary and not related to actual costs, especially
	for exports, and a de facto dual currency system.
	     In a memorandum backing its application presented to GATT
	last month, China said it was gradually reforming its economic
	system and replacing mandatory instruction with "guidance
	planning" and economic levers.
	     The diplomat said that, to join GATT, China had much to
	do.

	    European Community (EC) commissioner Willy de Clercq

	    The ministers have said they want to maintain the momentum

	Philippine Secretary of
	Trade and Industry Jose Concepcion, who two days ago expressed
	doubts about agreements produced at international conferences,
	said he was pleased with the latest gathering here.
	    Concepcion told Reuters in an interview that the informal
	General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) meeting gave
	ministers from more than 20 nations the chance to examine
	issues with which GATT did not have the political will to deal.
	    "Also, the role of the developing countries has been
	emphasised in this particular meeting. Somehow it has been the
	perception of developing countries that GATT is a club of rich
	countries," he added in an interview with Reuters.
	    "In fact many of the issues that have been tabled for
	discussion (in the Uruguay round of trade negotiations) will be
	of more benefit to the developed countries," he said.
	    Concepcion said at the start of the Taupo meeting that the
	Uruguay round was meant to be a "shining act of faith" in the
	world trade system.
	    Concepcion said the Philippines would address the issues of
	trade in tropical fruit and the improvement of GATT machinery
	to make it more responsive.
	    He said tropical fruit came from developing countries but
	faced non-tariff barriers, quantitative restrictions or very
	high duties in other nations. Concepcion named Japan and South
	Korea as examples.
	    He said he would go to Wellington for talks with New
	Zealand, which had a surplus in trade with the Philippines, to
	encourage it to switch imports from other countries. He noted
	that New Zealand bought its bananas from Ecuador.

	 EUROPE ON SIDELINES IN U.S-JAPAN MICROCHIP ROW
TOPICS:

CONTENT:
	Rising imports of Japanese-made cars and
	electronic goods may upset West European officials, but they
	generally seem prepared to stay on the sidelines in the latest
	trade row between the United States and Japan.
	    Japan's huge trade surplus is a sore point in West Europe,
	as it is in the United States. But U.S. Charges of unfair trade
	practices involving computer microchips leave Europeans cold.
	    The European Community ran a 18.2 billion dlr trade deficit
	with Japan last year, and seeks redress when it feels Japanese
	trade policy hurts Europeans, diplomats and economists said.
	    But only in Britain has there been any suggestion of acting
	with the U.S. To do something about Japan's huge trade surplus.
	    "The EC is no more illiberal on trade issues than is the
	U.S.," said Martin Wolf, director of studies at the Trade Policy
	Research Centre in London. "Basically, their policies are pretty
	much the same."
	    But that did not mean Europe would support the U.S., Or
	that the EC would climb on the bandwagon to take advantage of
	the U.S. Dispute to press its own claims, Wolf said.Basically,
	Europeans have a different approach to trade problems, he said.
	    "In the U.S., People talk about fair trade, but not here," he
	added. "In the U.S., It all has to do with the general ethic of
	free competition, while in Europe, the general approach is that
	liberal trade is good because it makes countries rich."
	    Wolf said this basic U.S. Attitude explains Washington's
	tendency to impose so-called "countervailing duties" - an import
	tax designed to offset advantages alleged to be unfair.
	    In Western Europe, the approach to trade disputes tends to
	be to try to reach a settlement through negotiation, Wolf said.
	    In the latest U.S.-Japan trade row, President Reagan has
	threatened to raise tariffs on selected Japanese electronic
	goods by as much as 300 mln dlrs, alleging that Japan has
	failed to abide by a 1986 U.S.-Japan pact on microchip trade.
	    But the European Community has challenged the agreement as
	a violation of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)
	practices that discriminates against its microchip producers.
	    "It follows that they're not likely to rally to the side of
	the United States in defence of the agreement," said Wolf.
	    Although British parliamentarians are pushing for a tough
	line on Japanese trade issues, government officials in the rest
	of Europe told Reuter correspondents they would let the EC take
	the lead in any response to the U.S.-Japan trade row.
	    A spokeswoman for the EC Commission in Brussels told
	Reuters there has been no change in the Community's position
	since a March 16 meeting of foreign ministers which sent a
	strong warning to Tokyo on trade imbalances.
	    In a statement issued after that meeting, EC foreign
	ministers deplored Japan's continued trade imbalance and
	appealed for a greater Japanese effort to open up its markets.
	    EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq said after
	the talks there was a growing impatience with Japan in the EC.
	    Diplomats accredited to the EC in Brussels said they saw no
	signs of any immediate intention to impose any broad-ranging
	sanctions against Japan. The EC is anxious to avoid provoking a
	trade war, they said.
	    Instead, the Community is trying to target problem areas in
	European trade with Japan, including wines and spirits,
	cosmetics, and financial services, and will continue talking to
	try to improve the situation, the diplomats said.
	    In Britain, where the government is angered over the
	difficulties telecommunications giant Cable and Wireless has
	faced in its bid to crack the Japanese market, officials said
	last week that retaliatory action is being considered.
	    But government officials said last night, "We are not
	talking about days or weeks. This is going to take time."
	    They said the government would consider its options at a
	cabinet meeting on Thursday, but added that no final decisions
	were expected. The main thing the British would threaten the
	Japan with is denial of access to London's booming financial
	markets, government officials said.

CONTENT:
	The House Ways and Means Committee
	is moving toward passage of a trade bill that sponsors said was
	intended to help open foreign markets to U.S. agricultural
	goods and to modify some U.S. agricultural trade laws.
	    The trade subcommittee voted to require President Reagan to
	take into account the potential harm to U.S. agricultural
	exports of any trade retaliation he might impose for foreign
	unfair trade practices against other domestic industries.
	    The bill would allow U.S. agricultural producers to seek
	government monitoring of imports if there is a reasonable
	chance the industry would be harmed by an import surge.
	    The full Ways and Means Committee is to consider the bill
	next week and congressional sources said they expect it will be
	approved.
	     In investigations involving a processed agricultural
	product, trade associations of processors or producers would
	have to petition for relief from foreign dumping or unfair
	duties.
	     The bill sets out U.S. trade negotiating objectives for
	the Uruguay round of talks under the General Agreement on
	Tariffs and Trade. It would seek fair trade in agriculture,
	seek to discipline restrictive or trade distorting import and
	export practices, to eliminate tariffs, subsidies, quotas and
	non-tariff barriers.
	     President Reagan's authority to negotiate a new GATT
	agreement would be extended through January 1993 and authority
	to negotiate a free trade zone with Canada would be extended
	through January 3, 1991.
	    The bill extends Reagan's authority to negotiate an
	international coffee agreement through October 31, 1989.
	    It allows a refund of import duties paid on raw sugar
	imported from November 1, 1977 to March 31, 1985 for production
	of sugar or products containing sugar and destined for
	re-export. The export of the sugar or products must occur
	before Octoer 1, 1991.
	    Presently, to qualify for the refund the sugar must be
	processed within three years after import and exported within
	five years.
	    Agriculture would also benefit from more rapid decisions in
	complaints of unfair foreign trade practices or injury from
	imports.

	Debt among African countries
	will continue to grow and their economies remain stifled unless

	    He told an informal General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade

	system were major impediments to growth in developing
	countries.
	    Delegates from 23 countries are attending the GATT talks in

	    "I wish to emphasise that the growth in the volume of the
	external indebtedness of African countries reflects the full
	effect of the deflationary monetary and trade policies of the
	developed market economy countries," Mamman said.
	    "The developed market economy countries have slowed down
	output growth thereby drying up markets for the commodity
	exports of African countries."
	    Mamman said the World Bank estimated 35.3 billion dlrs a
	year would be needed over the next five years for the African
	continent to be able to achieve a gross domestic product growth
	(GDP) rate of three to four pct by 1990.
	    Yet at the same time Africa's debt service was estimated at
	24.5 billion dlrs a year between 1986 and 1990.
	    "With the best of intentions Africa cannot attain a three to
	four pct GDP growth rate if the current high level of debt
	persists," Mamman said. Developed countries must seek
	alternatives to policies that resulted in the transfer of
	resources and more indebtedness, he said.
	    "The international community cannot fail to respond
	positively to the collapse of the international market for
	commodities ... And act quickly to stabilize demand and prices

	UK MINISTER SAYS FARM TALKS CAN USE OECD STUDY

	U.K. Agriculture Minister Michael
	Jopling said an OECD study which calculates the level of
	domestic farm subsidies in industrial countries would be a good
	basis for global agriculture negotiations now underway.
	    The controversial study, which has not yet been released by
	the Paris-based OECD, has calculated a measure of farm
	subsidies called the the Producer Subsidy Equivalent, PSE, OECD
	sources in Paris said last month.
	    Jopling, in a speech to the Commodity Club yesterday,
	suggested the PSE be refined as a starting point for reducing
	domestic farm policies during the Uruguay round of trade
	negotiations begun under the world trade agreement GATT.
	    The OECD study shows that there are few countries which do
	not significantly subsidize farmers, Jopling said.
	    The OECD study attempts to measure all farm subsidies for
	the years 1979 through 1981.
	    Jopling qualified his endorsement of the PSE as a
	negotiating tool, however, by saying the European Community
	would want "credit" in the negotiations for recent actions
	taken to reform the Common Agricultural Policy.
	    Representatives of other industrial countries told Reuters
	they are more skeptical than the U.K. about the PSE concept.
	    An Australian trade official said Canberra has "grave
	technical reservations" about the use of the PSE calculations.
	U.S. officials said there are several shortcomings to the study
	including the necessity to update the calculations to reflect
	recent changes in farm programs worldwide.
	    The officials said the study may be released in May.

	Japan has assured a meeting
	of trade ministers it is making every effort to expand domestic
	demand and restructure its economy.
	    Japanese trade representative Tsomu Hata told an informal
	General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) meeting that, in
	addition to demand boosting measures adopted last September, a
	comprehensive economic program will be prepared after the
	1987/88 budget is approved.
	    Hata, speaking at the first session of the two-day meeting,
	said agriculture is no exception to the goal of restructuring
	the economy, but did not elaborate.
	    Hata said protectionist pressures in the international
	economy are as strong as ever, reflecting financial deficits,
	payment imbalances and serious unemployment in many countries.
	    Despite great potential, developing economies are still
	confronted by grave difficulties, particularly debt, he added.
	    The basis for the talks is the GATT ministerial declaration
	last September in Punta del Este, Uruguay, and the subsequent
	trade negotiating plan agreed in Geneva.
	    "It is essential that we first reaffirm here our commitment
	to implementing that plan as scheduled," Hata said.
	    Hata added it is not constructive to speed up negotiations
	in some areas at the expense of others.
	    In order to rebuild the free trade system, it is important
	for each participant to have domestic policies that will serve
	this end.
	    As part of its contribution, Japan plans in April to
	fundamentally improve its generalised system of preferences for
	industrial and mining products to make Japan's domestic market
	more open to developing countries, he said.

CONTENT:
	U.S. Trade Representative
	Clayton Yeutter said trade ministers meeting here have reached
	a general consensus on agricultural trade reform under the
	latest Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
	Trade (GATT).
	    Yeutter gave no precise details of the understanding but
	told journalists the consensus covers the principles involved
	in agricultural trade reform and what needs to be done to
	improve the global situation in agriculture.
	    Delegates from 22 countries are meeting informally to
	discuss progress made since the latest GATT round was launched
	in Punta del Este, Uruguay, last September.
	    Yeutter said "at least people seem to be going down the same
	road...But how that translates ultimately into negotiations is
	another matter entirely."
	    There seems to be an understanding of the need to deal with
	the problem quickly and "a more common understanding of how we
	are going to get from here to there," Yeutter said.
	    However, the hard work is still to come, with a couple of
	years of tough negotiations ahead, he said.
	    "It is ludicrous for the nations of the world to plough
	immense amounts of financial resources into the production of
	items that nobody wants to buy," he said.
	    He said the long-term answer is to switch some of the
	financial resources now committed to agriculture to other more
	productive areas. This would help agriculture because some its
	inefficient non-productive segments would stop operating, he
	said.
	    Individual segments in many countries may lose in the
	process, but it should result in a more rational system of
	world-wide production within 10 or 15 years, he said.
	    It is important that the agriculture negotiations reach a
	relatively early conclusion because the U.S. Is spending 26
	billion dlrs a year and the European Community probably more
	than that, which is an ineffective use of financial resources,
	he said.
	    Asked about the prospect of a priority for agriculture in
	the negotiations, he said "one has to be politically
	realistic... If there is any chance of getting it (agricultural
	trade reform) done in two to three years it's going to have to
	be as part of a larger package."

	it will be neglecting the area of greatest crisis.
	    In a statement to the informal GATT trade ministers
	conference here he said agriculture is a problem which involves
	all countries and seriously affects the debt servicing
	abilities of a number of developing countries.
	     He said major countries should be showing leadership on
	this problem.
	    "We will be giving close attention to the processes in the
	OECD (Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development) and
	elsewhere leading to the Venice economic summit where we will
	be looking to the participants to adopt a strong commitment to
	agricultural trade reform," Dawkins said.
	    The Venice summit is scheduled for June.
	    He said Australia's interests in the Uruguay Round, the
	eighth under the GATT, are wide ranging. Dawkins said he sees
	the round as providing a timely opportunity to secure further
	meaningful trade liberalisation in all sectors and to restore
	confidence in the multilateral system.
	    Dawkins said initial meetings of the negotiating groups
	established in Geneva after the GATT declaration last September
	in Punta del Este, Uruguay, have made a reasonable start, but
	it is vital that trade ministers maintain the pressure on these
	processes.
	    "We must see that the commitments made at Punta del Este on
	standstill and rollback are carried into practice."
	    The standstill and rollback of protection offers the global
	trading system a chance to hold and wind back protection during
	the negotiations which are expected to last up to four years,

	U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
	Yeutter said it was all but certain President Reagan would go
	ahead today and impose curbs on Japanese exports as planned.
	    Asked in a television interview what the chance was for
	Reagan to cancel the scheduled 100 pct tariffs on Japanese
	electronic exports, he said "slim to none."
	    Reagan announced on March 27 he would impose the tariffs to
	retaliate for Japan's failure to honor a 1986 agreement to end
	dumping computer semiconductors in world markets at less than
	cost and to open its home markets to U.S. products.
	    Yeutter, on the NBC program "Today," said the United States
	did not want to terminate the agreement and would drop
	the tariffs once Japan began fulfilling the agreement.
	    He said Japanese negotiators last week told U.S. officials
	they were honoring the pact, but Yeutter said it would take
	time to monitor any compliance.
	    Asked how long that would take, he said "We want to see a
	pattern of compliance, so in a minimum I would say that would
	take a few weeks."
	    Yeutter said he did not think there would be much consumer
	impact by the tariffs on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods
	because the items selected are also readily available from
	other countries and manufacturers.
	    He said he did not think Japan would retaliate.
	    "It seems to me it is not in the interests of either country
	to get in an escalating conflict.  The Japanese understand that
	full well," Yeutter said.
	    He added Japan might challenge the tariffs in the General
	Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), but "that's more of a
	paper kind of exercise and I don't really expect to see any
	adverse impact on U.S. trade."
	    Yeutter also said he did not see any way the semiconductor
	issue could be resolved before or during a Washington visit
	later this month by Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.
	    He said he hoped the visit, which is to have trade as a
	major issue, would be productive but "I don't see any practical

	    The Japanese quotas on 12 food categories which the United

	    U.S. officials had hoped a ruling against the quotas would

	been delayed by the illness of the tribunal's chairman.
	    The U.S. has taken a hardline stance on the beef and citrus

	    The paper said Japanese agriculture has been slow to

	    The relative shortage of farmland in Japan is mainly
	responsible for higher domestic prices, it said.
	    The strong yen has meant lower input material prices but
	has also resulted in higher agricultural imports which has

	U.S. Trade Representative
	Clayton Yeutter said he was unsure whether some of the trade
	issues straining U.S.-Japanese relations would be resolved
	before the two countries open trade talks in late April.
	    "We are having high level discussions on them (the issues)
	within the United States...The relationship on some of those is
	very strained between us (Japan) at the moment and we need to
	relieve those strains at the earliest possible date," he said.
	    "I am not sure we can wait until late April," he added.
	    Yeutter is in New Zealand for a two-day informal meeting of
	trade ministers who are reviewing the Uruguay round of the
	General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT).
	    He said he will meet the Japanese delegation over the next
	few days but declined to discuss methods of relieving the
	strain between the two countries.
	    Yeutter said earlier the three most contentious trade
	issues were semiconductors, Japanese government unwillingness
	to allow public entities to buy U.S. Super-computers and the
	barring of U.S. Firms from the eight billion U.S. Dlr Kansai
	airport project near Osaka.
	    The Japanese delegation to the GATT talks said in a
	statement yesterday they are making major efforts to dismantle
	trade barriers in their country.
	    "I am convinced that they are attempting to move their
	policies in the right direction. The question is how far and
	how fast," Yeutter said.

	EC LINKS AGRICULTURAL TRADE TALKS TO OTHER REFORM

	The European Community (EC) considers
	talks on agricultural trade reform to be inseperable from talks
	on other trade reform in the present GATT round, Willy de
	Clercq, external relations commissioner of the EC, said.
	    He told reporters here the EC would not bow to pressure to
	reach an early, seperate agreement on agricultural trade.
	    He said the EC wanted to stick to the four-year schedule
	agreed by members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
	(GATT) in Punta del Este, Uruguay, last year. That included
	agricultural trade liberalisation for the first time in the
	lengthy program to re-negotiate the GATT.
	    Other trade issues being discussed in the current GATT
	round include reform of trade in merchandise and services.
	    De Clercq is on his way to China after attending a two-day
	conference for 22 GATT trade ministers held in New Zealand.
	    Several of those ministers criticised the EC for what they
	saw as restrictive agricultural trade practices and called for
	urgent reforms. U.S. Trade representative, Clayton Yeutter,
	also said it was important agreement on agricultural trade
	reform was reached as early as possible.
	    But de Clercq said the GATT program had been reached after
	long and hard negotiations, and the EC did not want changes.
	    "We just want to stick to the agreement which was reached,
	and that was very clear -- that the new round would be one
	undertaking. It is a global negotiation with no two tracks, no
	fast track, no slow track. It has just one track, the track -
	and that's all," de Clercq said.
	    "If you start selecting priorities, your priority is not my
	priority. We say that agriculture is urgent, but it's not the
	only urgent thing," he said.
	    He said the Punte del Este agreement had taken eight months
	to prepare and eight days of negotiations.

	ASA SAYS EC OILSEED POLICY ILLEGAL UNDER GATT

CONTENT:
	The American Soybean Association (ASA)
	denounced European Community (EC) oilseed policies as illegal
	under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and
	threatened to make an unfair trade complaint if the EC does not
	remedy the situation.
	    ASA Vice President James Adams told an ASA-sponsored
	Outlook 87 conference: "It will be filed unless the EC takes
	drastic and immediate steps."
	    "These subsidies are blatantly unfair and are GATT illegal,
	since they were established after the zero soybean duty was
	established in 1962," he said.
	    The ASA's unfair trade petition against the EC would ask
	for an investigation and modification of EC oilseed policies to
	make the regime non-discriminatory.
	    The EC in 1962 ruled all EC oilseed imports duty-free, in
	an effort to fill its oilseed needs. But EC oilseeds production
	has risen dramatically since then.
	    The EC now guarantees oilseed prices to farmers above world
	market levels and is considering implementing a controversial
	oils and fats tax.
	    The subsidies "are obvious attempts to circumvent the zero
	duty binding and that makes U.S. Farmers mad as hell," Adams
	said.
	    The ASA is confident the U.S. Congress will support its
	trade complaint, Adams said. The ASA also strongly opposes an
	EC proposal to tax vegetable and marine oils consumed in the
	EC, which will be considered by the EC Commission in December.
	    U.S. Soybean world market share has declined 35 pct in
	volume and 40 pct in value since 1982, primarily as a result of
	EC policies, Adams added.
	    Lord Plumb, European Parliament President and a speaker at
	the conference, said the EC expanded oilseed production in 1973
	when the U.S. Halted overseas sales of soy products.

	U.S. TAKES TOUGH STAND ON GATT FARM ISSUES
TOPICS:

CONTENT:
	The United States is prepared to "pull out
	all the stops" to defend its agricultural trade rights under the
	General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), U.S. Ambassador
	to GATT Michael Samuels said.
	    Those rights are now being challenged by the European
	Community's (EC) agricultural support policies, he told a
	conference sponsored by the American Soybean Association.
	    He reiterated Washington's firm intention to retaliate if
	the EC goes ahead and bans imports of hormone-fed beef without
	the issue being investigated by a GATT special committee.
	    The U.S. claims the EC directive, due to come into effect
	on January 1, threatens to cut 100 mln dlrs worth of U.S. meat
	shipments into the EC.
	    The U.S. also will oppose all EC efforts to impair U.S.
	trade via the EC oilseeds regime, which supports EC oilseed
	prices over the current market level and which may be extended
	to include a hotly disputed oils and fats tax, Samuels said.
	    Reduction of trade-distorting world agricultural subsidies,
	an aim of most key participants in GATT multilateral trade
	negotiations, "is meaningless if import barriers continue to be
	erected," Samuels said.
	    Samuels called the U.S. plan to eliminate world farm
	subsidies by the year 2000, proposed at GATT in July, "visionary"
	and "very serious."  The EC and Japan have said it is
	unrealistic.
	    The EC Commission this month announced its draft proposal
	on farm trade reform, expected to be tabled at GATT formally
	next week.
	    The EC scheme involves emergency measures to reduce
	tensions in troubled surplus sectors of cereals and cereals
	substitutes, dairy and sugar. It also calls for reduction of
	farm subsidies.
	    The U.S. Is not opposed to short-term measures, as long as
	they are directly linked to long-term commitments to end major
	trade distortions, Samuels said.
	    Washington will review the EC proposal when it is formally
	submitted and respond to it officially then.
	    "We will consider its relation to the Punta del Este
	declaration to correct trade problems and expand market access,"
	the U.S. Ambassador said.
	    The U.S. can say no to the EC proposal if the EC ignores
	the U.S. plan when it tables its own proposal, he added.
	    The key difference between the two approaches is that the
	U.S. wants farm subsidies eliminated, while the EC is pushing
	only for a reduction in farm suppports, Samuels said.
	    If the EC farm budget were protected by a subsidy freeze,
	there would be little incentive for the Community to work to
	correct the international trade situation, he added.
	    Samuels cited the animal hormones complaint, the EC
	oilseeds regime and an EC regulation concerning meat imports to
	third countries as three crucial barriers to trade which the
	U.S. wants to see resolved under the auspices of GATT.

	WORLD ECONOMIC CONVERGENCE VITAL, OECD ENVOY SAYS

	It is vitally important that the
	industrialised countries of the world work towards convergence
	of their economies and economic policies, U.S. Ambassador to
	the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
	Edward Streator said.
	    He told an American Chamber of Commerce lunch the world was
	changing rapidly and national attitudes had to alter
	accordingly if growth was not to falter and world depression
	set in.
	    Liberalisation of world trade in money, goods and services
	and technology was an overriding goal, he added.
	    World financial flows were now 12 times as large as
	traditional trade flows, the importance of commodities was
	declining rapidly, countries such as those on the Pacific Rim
	were becoming major growth areas, and the labour element in
	manufacturing was declining sharply, Streator said.
	    All these factors were creating major social and economic
	pressures and demanding a rapid reassessment of traditional
	attitudes, he added.
	    "Agriculture is a prime target for change.One of the first
	things we must do is disconnect farm subsidies from production,"
	Streator said.
	    At an OECD ministerial meeting in two weeks time there
	would be an attempt to agree global principles to help reduce
	this major agricultural problem, Streator said.
	    "However, of equal and vital importance in reducing the
	world's dangerous slide towards protectionism will be the
	outcome of the new round of talks under the General Agreement
	on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)," Streator added.
	    Dutch finance minister Onno Ruding, who also spoke briefly
	at the lunch, stressed the importance of coordinating national
	policies and of the GATT talks in preventing a rapid decline
	into bilateralism and global protectionism.

	CHINA TAKES SERIOUS VIEW OF MFA EXTENSION

	China took a serious view of a Multi-Fibre
	Agreement (MFA) protocol which it said infringed principles of
	the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the People's
	Daily overseas edition said.
	    It quoted a spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Economic
	Relations and Trade as saying the protocol, signed on July 31
	last year and which extended the MFA for five years, would
	affect international textile trade by broadening curbs in it.
	    Fifty major textile trading countries adopted the new MFA
	last July in Geneva, limiting Third World exports of textiles
	to industrialised countries.
	    The newspaper said China signed the protocol on May 31, 10
	months after it was signed by other nations.
	    A U.S. Diplomat said the U.S. And China had had months of
	talks on the issue, with the U.S. Saying that it would have to
	introduce unilateral restraints if China did not sign.
	    He said that the new MFA pact extended controls to silk and
	ramie in addition to existing ones on cotton and man-made
	fibres.
	    China, the world's biggest producer of ramie and a major
	silk producer, had flooded the U.S. Market the previous two
	years with goods made from both and from linen because these
	three categories were not under quota, the diplomat said.
	    It had become the biggest supplier by volume, though not by
	value, of textiles to the U.S., With exports in the first five
	months of this year up by 24 pct from the same 1986 period.
	    He estimated total 1987 textile exports would be 15 pct up
	on the 1986 level.
	    Chinese customs figures show exports of textile yarn,
	fabrics, made-up articles and related products to the U.S. In
	calendar 1986 as being worth 1.314 billion yuan, up from 870
	mln in 1985.
	    The diplomat said China and the U.S. Had held two rounds of
	talks on drawing up a new three to five-year textile pact, to
	replace the present one, due to expire at the end of 1987.
	    They involved discussion of overshipment of Chinese
	textiles this year to the U.S. Due to counterfeit licences, a
	problem the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade
	admitted to last week, he said, but gave no more details.

	The United States and Japan
	are on the brink of serious conflict on trade, especially over
	semiconductors, Japanese unwillingness for public bodies to buy
	U.S. Super-computers, and barriers to U.S. Firms seeking to
	participate in the eight billion dlr Kansai airport project,
	U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said.
	    He was talking to reporters yesterday on the eve of a
	two-day meeting of trade ministers which will review progress
	made by committees set up after the Uruguay meeting last
	September launched a new round of GATT (General Agreement on
	Tariffs and Trade) talks.
	    European Community (EC) commissioner Willy de Clercq
	meanwhile told reporters conflict between the world's three
	major trading and economic powers -- the EC, the U.S. And Japan
	-- set a poor example for other members of GATT.
	    Australian Trade Minister John Dawkins told the reporters
	bilateral retaliation at the enormous expense of the rest of
	the world was no way to solve trade disputes.
	    New Zealand trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues
	great progress had been made in preparing for the current round
	of GATT negotiations which must not be sidetracked.
	    The ministers have said they want to maintain the momentum
	towards fresh negotiations or avert serious trade conflicts.
	    Yeutter said the problem with international trade talks was
	that they tended to get bogged down for years. "Countries don't
	get very serious about negotiating until the end of the day
	which is, maybe, five or six years in the future."
	    He also said he did not consider the new U.S. Congress as
	protectionist as it was 18 months ago. "That's a very healthy
	development," he added."If you asked me about that a year or 18
	months ago I would have said that it was terribly
	protectionist."
	    "Members of Congress, that is the contemplative members of
	Congress, have begun to realise protectionism is not the answer
	to the 170 billion dlr trade deficit," Yeutter said.
	    "They've also begun to realise that you cannot legislate
	solutions to a 170 billion dollar trade deficit so they are
	more realistic and, in my judgement, more responsible on that
	issue than they were 12 or 18 months ago."
	    He added, "Whether that will be reflected in the legislation
	that eventually emerges is another matter."
